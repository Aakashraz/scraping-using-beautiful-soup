Could it be the creepy husband of the head mistress at the school, the psychologist who seems to be taking an unusual interest in the case, or something altogether more sinister?","

        Class is over.Janet and Mary can clean up today.And don't forget to wash your brushes!- Come on, hurry up.- I'll only be a second.Bye!- Bye, see you in the morning.- Bye.- Goodbye.- Bye.Give her my love!Not likely!Never...believe her...



- Good morning, Doctor.- Good morning.Good of you to come.I hope this doesn't take too long.I'm due at the hospital.Well...Oh, no - not again.Give us your first impression, Doctor.If you bring me in every time youbring in some tramp...This isn't any old tramp, Doctor.This fellow was seen near Devil's Endat the time the Hurst girl was attacked.What do you know about him?Intelligence subnormal. No alibi...We are holding him for breaking andentering. 12 counts.All houses where a woman lives alone.He hides and watches them undress.



- He just watches?- Yes.- When was his last offense?- Thursday night.Well, keep looking.Why? Don't you suspect him?Peeping Toms want sex with no contact.Rape is on the other end of the scale.Sex appetites sometimes change.Yes, but not backwards.He's not going to rape a girl, and thengo back to peeping in keyholes.We're clutching at straws.It's been two months with no leads.We have to get him. Next time, itcould be murder.- How's the girl? Still the same?- Yes.You should look for a young man,who lives at home with no father and adomineering mother.Or someone older - a psychotic wholives alone with no one to observe them.Or the middle-aged type. Someone whohangs around playgrounds...- Or an inhibited family man.- Like this Peeping Tom?Or like you maybe. I don't know.- Tell me what you know.- Good morning.- Come on!- Excuse me.Thank you, Doctor. Keep me informedabout the Hurst girl.Chief, I know you're busy but who is it?- Just give me his name.- False alarm.- That's all I'm telling you.- The boys are betting on your promotion.- Who tipped you off?- I'll never tell.- Good morning, Doctor.- Good morning.There you are!Golfing good? How are the greens?- I had to go to the Police Station.- I wondered what delayed you.- They wanted me opinion on a suspect.- A suspect?For the Hurst case?- Likely suspect?- No.- How is the girl doing?- No change.That's a shame, poor kid.Keep trying.Hello, Tessa.You are early today.Where's your mother? Gone shopping?We are going to get wet. It's isstarting to rain.Shall we join the others on the terrace?Come on.I know what you would like -to play with your old friends again.Would you like that?Do you mind if we join you?Thanks.Tessa, let's see if you are ready yet.Here it comes...Shall we try again?Leave your paintings where they areand we will have the criticism tomorrow.Don't forget to wash you brushes!Janet...Wipe your mouth!- But Mrs. Sanford...- Wipe it!I don't care what you do at home,but you cannot wear makeup onschool property.- Good evening Mrs. Sanford.- Good night, Jenny.Mr. Sanford, have you see the gardener?I'd like some fresh flowers to put....- Sorry, girls.- That's alright.Where's Susan?She was in a hurry.I think she went with Mr. Sanford.Are you sure?That's what she said.You saw her getting into Mr. Sanford's car?You know why I'm asking.You know why we have this ruleabout girls not walking home.Yes.Did you see her?No.Which way did she go?Susan!Susan!Susan! Susan!Susan!Susan!All together girls.SUSAN!Once again...SUSAN!Susan!You can hear a thing here. We willlook for her.Don't argue. Come on, get in.Keep looking.Do you see anything at all?No.- Oh. no!- Don't panic.I'm going to reverse.Keep your heads down.Can't we move the car?- Come on, let's get out and push.- No!It's bad enough being stuck herewithout getting covered in mud.We can't just sit here.I'm going outside to get some woodto put under the back wheels.You can blow the horn for an S.O.S.- Do you know how?- Yes.Don't leave the car.That's an order!- Do you all understand?- Yes, Miss West.There! And another.Good. Come on.Right - one here.Hey, Superintendent. What abouta statement?- Come out!- Oh, come on Sarge!I didn't put these ropes here for fun!How will you get your facts if I don'twrite them up for you?Not too close together!Don't spread out too much!Keep in constant contact with me, please.Sergeant Beale!- Are you sure these roads are closed?- Yes, sir. Sealed tight.Then where are all these peoplecoming from?Their own back gardens. We can't sealoff the houses too.We don't have enough men.Well, he's gone then. Isn't he?Over someones back wall and over tothe high street.For all we know, it could be one of them.Alright, Jim. Let me know when the menget to the bottom road.Jim! Get the reporters away.- Hey! Come on!- Aw, come on.- Where were you?- On my way home.Susan Miller. Age 15 years, one month.Assaulted and strangled.- In that order?- Impossible to say. Why do you ask?It's basic - was death part of the sex act?Or was it just to silence the victim?Let's don't get too academic.- It's another psychological identification.- I know.- How did this happen?- She's from the same school as the other one.Coincidence?Just one girl in 2 months left thatschool on foot, and she runs into him.I mean, does he live here?Is it likely he practically campson this trail?Perhaps she had a date with him.No, she had a date with a boy on theother side of town. We checked.I'm wondering about that school itself.Somebody in it.One of the houses on the other side ofthe common.- Any luck?- No decent footprints.It's too wet.Forget it.Anyway, I'm trying not to let everyoneknow that I've got an eyewitness.Who?She...She hasn't made much sense yet.She's in shock.Maybe you could help get adescription of the man from her.Extract it the way...you know.- I can try.- She's the Art teacher at the school.She knew both of the girls quite well.Miss West, I've brought Dr. Lomax tokeep you company.Hello.I know you thought I was hystericalbefore, but...No...after what you've been through,most women would have...Don't treat me like a child. If youwould just listen...I can tell you exactly what happened.In time. Just relax. Doctor, lookafter her.- He won't listen to me!- He will.Take one of these.No.It will calm you down.Take your time and describe exactlywhat you saw.Well, we were driving along this road...we came to some mud.I skidded...I tried to back out,and then...I looked out of the back window, andAnd then, what?Sir!They have reached the bottom road.- Nothing?- Nothing.What do I tell them?Well?- Well, indeed.- Come on, let's have it.Maybe it's the surroundings,I don't know...take her to the office and try againlater.That was useless.Alright, sergeant.

You have to letme see her.I'm coming anyway.It's like a nightmare.No one could be more careful thanwe've been.Forgive me.We understand, Mrs. Sanford. We justwant to look around the school.Ask a few questions, you don't minddo you?- She broke the rules.- I know.- May we look at the staff list?- Lesley...Did I see you at the crime scene?Probably.- You didn't tell me you had been there.Which of you runs the school?I do.And you sir, do you teach?My husband is the administrator.I keep an eye on the gardener.Nonsense! You do the accounting.Roll the occasional pitch.I have to go. My husband will showyou around the school.Go ahead, Mrs. Sanford. We want yourstatement later.Say the word.We want a quick look around, anda few details about the staff.- Upstairs...- Okay.Did you go to the common before orafter the police arrived?After.How did you get in? The lane wassealed off.There is a path around the back.I always walk the dog that way.Will Miss Julie West take the witnessstand, please?Miss Julie West!Take the book in your right hand andread the card.I swear by almighty God that I willtell the truth and nothing but the truth.You are Miss Julie West of East Lodge,Wood Lane?That's correct.Miss West, tell us in your own wordsexactly what happened on the nightin question.I left the school late that evening,the girls I take in the car had towait for me.It wasn't until we reached...I realized one of the girls was missing...- Give me a cigarette.- You don't smoke!I think I will start.I can't bare to hear that all again.She seems intelligent.Why should she imagine these things?Or does she imagine them?I really thought - I mean a witness...I thought, ""we've got him.""We better go back in.No - you go.Could you see his face?In detail.But wasn't it dark?The car lights were on.Can you describe the man you saw?It looked, hmm...exactly like the devil.You mean, Satan?Yes.I see...For the benefit of those of us notfamiliar with his appearance,could you describe him for us, please?There was a...a kind of glow about him.A red glow.His eyes were luminous.Did he have horns?Horns?The devil's supposed to have horns.I know you think this is crazy, but I'mtelling you what I saw.It could have been a mask or something,but I'm just telling you what I saw!Very well,a mask......but no horns.No horns.How about a beard or mustache?I can't be sure.But you said you saw every detail.Every detail of the effect, but I'mspeaking as an artist.I believe you ARE, Miss West.Thank you, Miss West. I see no need totake anymore of your valuable time.Order! Order!There will be a 20 minute recess beforeproceeding with this inquiry.- Don't be that way, Darling. All I want...- Leave me alone!Look girly -Look,talk to me and I'll protect you fromthe others.Get away!What the hell are you doing?Go away and leave her alone!Come on now.You okay?- A pill for every occasion?- We're working towards it.- Take one of these.- Thank you.I told them the absolute truth.i know.Look, I came after you to warn you.You could be in danger.Whoever killed Susan knows whoyou are now.- You're not suggesting...- It's a possibility.- Surely with him it's a sick thing.- Not anymore.Now, it's a survival thing.Now, he has a psychopathic disregardfor human life.Then why didn't he kill Tessa?She saw him.From his viewpoint, she's already dead.She's locked the episode so deep inside thateven face-to-face, she wouldn'trecognize him now.How can he be sure that she will notrecover?He can't.Maybe he's watching.He may be someone close to all of us.I don't know.Just please be careful.Will you?Julie, look at me.Do you notice anything?The satanic glow.The reverse lights.Perhaps, but what about theluminous eyes?Could be eyeglasses reflecting.No, I don't think so. They aremuch smaller.I'm sure they were real eyes.Do you understand what I'm saying?Forget the color effect for the moment,try to remember the basic features.So, now I know where you live.- Yes, thank you.- A pleasure.Will you have dinner with me tomorrownight?- That's very kind of you, but...- No ""buts"", love. You're coming.- Well, I think...- 7 o'clock on the dot.- I'd love to.- Great.Goodbye.Julie...You remember - be careful.- Of course I will.- Goodbye.Don't lock the door!What the hell is the matter with you?All I want from you is an exclusivestory.What happened that night in yourown words.Go away - leave me alone!We will pay you.A lot...perhaps thousands.Yes, sir. Six-fifty. Yes.Very good. We will make a note of it.Yes. Right sir, goodbye.Ah, his Lordship!Step straight this way, sir.- What's this about, sergeant?- You will find out.Come in, Denning.You know Miss West?Would you take a careful look at theseportraits?You could see better if you took thoseglasses off.I can see alright.The Hurst girl?Yes.- Okay. Now what?- Sit down.Would someone mind telling me...I don't know either.I brought the portraits along to provethat I can paint a good likeness.- Do you agree?- You did those?- You're good darling.- We agree.Here's 2 sketches of devils.Everyone's idea of devils.My idea is this, but it may not work.Suppose an article appeared on thefront page of The Advertiser,written by you Mr. Denning.The headline to read something like""Can Murder Witness Draw Killer?""The sketches would appear withthe article as a teaser.A teaser for the real picture of thekiller to appear in the next edition.Understand?Well?- It's fantastic!- Wait a minute...you're offering to set yourself upas a target?Yes. If these appear in theSaturday editionwith a promise of the real picturein the Wednesday edition,that would give the killer 4 days...Four days in which to kill you.No. I don't like it.- Come on, Chief! It's a great idea!- No, I don't like it.We're exposing a civilian.I'm volunteering!It wouldn't work. He's not thatkind of killerDr. Lomax thinks he is.Was this his idea?No, nothing to do with him.Do you have a better idea, Chief?Like sprinkling salt on his tail?Shut up, Denning.It will be new.Keep you under surveillance nightand day...mobile strike forces on the alert...It's too dangerous.If you've decided to do it,he can't stop you.I know.It's crazy. Absolutely crazy.It's so crazy, it might work.Now watch.Here it comes.Here you are.That's very good, Tessa.Yes, I'll tell him as soon as he comes in.That's alright. Thank you.Betty, if there's anything urgent I'llbe at this number.- Bristol?- Yes, the annual conference.- Good morning, Mrs. Hurst.- Good morning.- How is Tessa today?- She's doing very well.Splendid.- Are you going to Bristol?- Yes.I'm sorry I can't make it this year.Well, I mustn't keep you.- Good morning, Mr. Bartell.- Good morning. Any calls?I'll look.Would you steady me?- Leslie...- Yes?Have you seen this?Yes.You might have warned me.I've been trying to calm the parents' fears.Bury their heads in the sand?- I don't think she did it deliberately.- I think it was.What do you mean?She set a trap for him.From now on, she will be in danger.- From whom?- Whoever it is.I'm only concerned with the school.Naturally.Otherwise, it I thought it hadanything to do with us...What would you do?Expel me?Miss West!It's alright, Miss. I'm Sgt. Milton.I'm your watchdog.Let me see your credentials.Wherever you go, I'll follow.Don't look for me. Act natural.When you're in the house, keep thedoor locked.When you leave, don't drive fast.Just drive steady.- Any messages, Jean?- Yes.Your mail, Doctor!- Hello?- Miss West?- Yes.- Miss West, is she with you?- Who?- Jeanie. This is Mr. Greenway.You haven't seen her?No, she isn't with me.She's gone. She was in bed sick.My wife thought she may be with you.If not, I'm scared.You mean the common? Why?She's been delirious talking aboutSusan and how she must help her.- I must look for her.- Yes, of course.Could you drive? Oh, no you shouldn'tat night.- You mean down there?- Yes, in your car.- I will come from the other side.- I think it's a matter for the police.There is no time. Even now she may be...Wait...Are you there, Miss West?I'll come.Thank you. I'll meet you at the bottomof the valley.- Hello?- Hello.May I speak to Mr. Greenway?I'm sorry. They are both out for theevening. This is Mrs. Greenway's mother.I'll call back later.I want to speak to you.- Later.- Now!Leslie!Leslie, I want to speak to you!Right - have you got that?Come in control.Come in control. We will be reportingour position. Over and out.You know where to position your men.Take your squad to the other end.Milton...- Milton?- Yes sir?We're in position. We will waitfor your signal.Okay.Keep moving, Miss.Stop here.Put the light out, Miss.Leave the side lights on.Get in the back, Miss.Why?Please do as I say.Hide under the rug.Stay there and don't move. I willbe nearby.You men go on the main road - now!- Did you get him?- No sir.Come on, come on.You alright?Right there?Get a doctor. Did you see who did it?You didn't?- What are you doing here?- I've been following you.Milton, get him out of here.Hello? Sounds like they have got him.Alright, alright.Come on, up you go.How far away were you?- 20 feet.- But you didn't get a good look at him?How could I? It was very dark.Alright...Let's recap.Again?- I got back to the hospital...- What time?About nine o'clock.I read your scheme in the paper.I was going to her place when I sawher car driving towards the common.I left my car, and followed on foot.- Because you had a flat tire?- Yes, You can check that.I will.When you got to where she was parked,what happened?Someone was there. I saw a shape inthe back of her car.Then he ran away.- And you ran after him?- Right.He knows those woods. He vanished.I see.- How are you for anti-tetanus?- Good.Now, if you don't mind I'm goingto see Julie.- Assuming that I'm not under arrest.- I'll come with you.Hang on a second, chief!I should break your neck for printingthat story.Let go!It wasn't my idea.- Chief, I remembered something important!- Not now - just a minute!Milton, let him through. Now what is it?Are you alright?I wanted to tell you, but I thoughtyou would disapprove.You thought right!...just running about in the woods.When I came to where you were.A dog? What type?A big one. Yellow in color. I thought,""it must have someone with it.""I had a look. No one was there.Yellow? A Labrador?Yes! That's it!Thank you, Denning.Get the car. Miss West, go home please.Milton stay with her.I'll get a cab and take you home.Let's look around the back.There's something I want to check.Still wet. Put these in the car.Jim, send Thomas to find the path downto Devil's End.Tell him to walk along it. I wantsome timings.- Hello, Mrs.Sanford.- Well, Mr. Velyan.Mind if I come in?Thank you.Is your husband here?He's in his workshop.- Do you want me to call him?- Not now.Has he been out this evening?I'm not sure. Why?Did he take the dog for a walk?No, I remember now. We've beentogether all evening.Why do you ask?Nice dog - what's his name?- Grip.- Does Grip go off on his own?Sometimes, I suppose.This evening?It's possible. I did let him out for awhile.- About 7 o'clock?- About then.Would he go as far as the commonon his own?He might. It depends if there's abitch in season.I see.""His hand felt like a snake.""Go on, talking may help.Well,as he pressed on me...I, I felt he was sexually excited.He squeezed with his fingertips,exactly on the pressure points.Exactly like a doctor.Did you tell Velyan that?No.No, I had not thought of it until now.- What brought you back?- Leslie, this is...Your wife says that you haven't leftthe house this evening.Has she?I wonder why she said that.Have you?I took the dog for a walk. My wife'sdog. It's one of my duties.- She should remember.- To Devil's End?Where else?Stop beating around the bush and ask me,""Did I rape those girls?""Did you, Mr. Sanford?I could have.He's lying. He's trying to hurt me.My wife's covering for me because shethinks I did it.There's your first witness, Velyan.Ask her if we sleep together.Answer -no.Why not?Because there's not room for 2 menin one marriage.She runs the school capably.All by herself.It's hers.She bought it with her own money.That makes her the breadwinner.And me?The dog's buddy.Is it surprising I prefer the girls?Young, fresh creatures with nomale hormones.Leslie! No, please!Yes.I raped those girls.I raped all the others too.Every time I look at them.- Sleeping pills?- Yes.- Three?- Yes, and no argument.Don't forget to lock the door.No need to - I'm staying with you.I'll sleep there. I don't want any moremistakes.You don't mind?We will not trouble you any longer,Mrs. Sanford.You're not going to arrest me?We are not thought police, we deal incrimes of fact, not fantasy.Yes, but I confessed.At least, you can take me to the stationfor questioning.I know you would like that.The publicity would destroy this school.That's what you want, isn't it?So you are prepared to take a chanceon me to...save this school?You were still in the building the nightthat Susan Miller slipped out.The night she was killed.I left just after she did.- Not by the front door.- By the slipway.The slipway comes out into the common -400 yards from the main track.One minute's running time.And it's separated by marshland.Unless you have wings...No one was further from them.You could not have reached thegirl in time.Let alone, rape and strangle her.Even if you were capable.Good try.Good night.Julie.Come on to bed.Good night.Central control to Charlie Fox.Charlie Fox, over.Message received from Sgt. Milton.Message reads: Dr. Lomax staying atMiss West's home.Please confirm he's been clearedas a suspect.Oh, my God.Shall I confirm, sir?Wait a minute.- What do you think, Jim?- It's a risk.Pass a message to Milton:Leave Dr. Lomax where he is.Julie. Julie, wake up.- Hello?- Oh, thank God.Velyan here. Just checking to be sureyou are alright.I'm fine.Velyan.John, it's Lomax. How soon canyou get over here?- Half an hour. Why?- I'll tell you when you get here.- Good sleep?- Yes.You're not planning another devil hunt,I hope.No.There is a way to unlock Tessa's mind.But John, there is a risk.Pentathol can release locked memories.Maybe she could remember what happened.What about the shock?It could drive it even deeper inside her.That's the risk.My hope is that it could cure hercompletely.It's her parents' decision.They left it to me to decide.And I've decided.Will she be able to talk?Almost certainly.Enough to describe her attacker?And to identify his picture.Without her testimony, you would have to find more evidence.Of course.Shall I do it?Yes, do it.- Right, doctor. When?- 7 o'clock tonight.- So soon?- Is that possible?- I'll do my best.- Thanks.Just a minute!As head of this hospital, shouldn't Ibe consulted first?Thank you. I'll speak to Dr. Lomax.My car's broken down. Will you takeme home? We'll talk then.She's my patient. It's none of yourbusiness.Anything you do at the hospital ISmy business.Okay - what are your objections?Police trampling through the hospital;drug experiments...Drug therapy.Danger to the girl...- That's my concern.- The first two are mine.You would let that stand in the way of a cure?Cure, Lomax?You live on a cloud.She's responding. The pentathol couldsnap her out of it.Responding? That makes a difference.This way.My new consulting rooms.Fully equipped:instruments, dispensary, oxygen.- Everything you will need.- You mean do it here?Of course! What time did you say - 7?- Yes, but it's too much trouble.- It's no trouble.I'll tell them to have the pentathol ready.You can get it on your way here.- I appreciate it, but...- No buts. And I'll assist you myself.Helping unmask the killer will giveme deep satisfaction.Whatever you say.Do you want a drink?No thanks. I haven't the time.- Do you have a package for me?- He didn't reach you?- Who?- Mr. Bartell. He said he'd call you.No. What did he want?- Sodium pentathol - we're out of it.- Out of it?According to my stock, we are.But according to my records, there should be a full bottle right there.- Did someone take it?- It was there yesterday.However, no problem...you can get some at the pharmacyon High Street.Their dispenser is working on it now.He opened just for you.Thank Bartell - he arranged it.Tessa?Hello, Tessa. Are you alright?- We better get her inside.- Of course.Right on time!Good evening, Superintendent.Sergeant.Hello, young lady.Mr. Bartell, this is Miss West. She's here instead of the parents.Dr, Lomax thought it better if she were here.Of course.Very wise.Come in. Dr, Lomax won't be long.Hello?Anyone there?Hello?Hello? Anyone in there?The lights won't work.The door was open, and uh...Come in, love.- I don't have a handkerchief.- Here you are.Hold your nose tight.Very tight, alright?Head back.Do you have any paper handkerchiefs?I'm not the chemist. There's cottonwool here.Oh, great.She will be okay. Bring your lighter over here. I have to find something.Hey!- You said you weren't the chemist.- It's alright. I'm a doctor.- Then you should fix her nose bleeds.- She should consult her own doctor.Alright.God, another accident.Always on a Sunday.Bad drivers.Alright Miss West. You can bring theyoung lady in now.Come in, Tessa.Wonder what a place like this costs?More than you can afford.H2 calling, sir.Oh - wait here, Jim.I'm sorry we have to go. The experimentis canceled.Miss West, you will have to takeTessa home.Sorry, Mr. Bartel, but we have an emergency.Well, That's that.Too bad that they can't stay, but wecan carry on.- But the experiment was for them!- Experiment?This is remedial treatment, Miss West.We're here to see that this poorgirl gets well.- Hello, John.- My god! Are you alright? What happened?- Gas explosion, Superintendent.- Who were the other two?A couple who came in off the street.He had a lighter and was helping me.His girlfriend is next door being treated for shock.- Who was the other one?- The chemistHe was dead before the explosion.The place seemed empty, John.Look at this. Someones removed allthe fuses.- What were you doing here?- Getting the pentathol.This looks deliberate.Will this stop the experiment with Tessa?Maybe.Dr. Lomax, We must get you back to thehospital.He can go with me. We can talk aboutit on the way.You aren't going to start withoutDr. Lomax, are you?Mr. Bartell - Tessa's my responsibility.Do you hear me?I don't want you too continue withoutDr. Lomax.Mr. Bartell, I forbid it!Sit down, Miss West and remain silent!YOU!Help me Milton!Help me Milton!Stop him! Stop Mr. Bartell!Tessa!Tessa!I'll radio for help.Mike Victor to control. Tessa!Charlie Fox, come in please.Charlie Fox, over.Message from Sgt. Milton:""Mr. Bartell suspected of kidnappingTessa Hurst.Believed to have entered Devil's Endfrom the vicinity of his home.""No, doctor! No!Lovely hair.I won't hurt you.I won't hurt you.Don't give him room to get through!- Any sign of him?- No. Nowhere, sir.There he is!"

        (dramatic music)- Skipper.This is Commander Wayne.- How do you do, sir?- You got here sooner than we expected.- The department said it was urgent.- Well, Dr. LaSatier seems to think so.- And you don't, huh?- Well, I don't know what to think.There's something odd going on down there.That's for sure.



Boatswain, prepare the service bell.Now we can send you downanytime you're ready.- I'm ready right now, sir.- Inform the sea labthat the commander's hereand he'll be down right away.- Hello, Sea Lab.Hello, Sea Lab, this is top side.Do you receive, over?- [Man] This is Sea Lab.Go ahead, top side.- [Operator] Inform Dr. LaSatierthat Commander Wayne has arrived.We're sending him down right away.- I take it you've neverbeen aboard the Sea Lab.



- No, I haven't.- Well, it gets a littlehairy down there at times.I spent three days aboard myself,but I guess you'll get used to it.- Don't suppose you've everbeen aboard a submarinecruising under an icecap, now have you skipper?- (chuckling) Well no,I haven't, I haven't.- Gets a little hairy down there too.- Well, I imagine so, Commander.- The service bill is ready, Skipper.- Good luck,- Thank you, sir.- I'll tell you what thing, Skipper.I'm sure as heck gladI pulled top side dutyon this project.- Could be he'll be wishing he was backaboard to his submarinebefore this is over.(suspenseful music)(spool spinning)(water splashing)(bell ringing)- Colonel Wayne?- Yes, sir.- I'm Dr. James, Company Medical Officer.- How you do?- This is Dr. Rene Peron,our marine biologist.- Pleased to meet you.- Commander Wayne, Dr.LaSatier is waiting for youin the control room, and HoLee will take your things.- Fine.- Right this way, Commander.- Well, all the comfortsof a luxury liner, huh?- We do have some comforts.- So I see.(tense music)- Commander LaSatier, Commander Wayen.- You've arrived at theopportune moment, Commander.The object has returned.It's moving closer.(electronic beeping)- How long has it been out there?- Two hours.Yesterday, it appeared for 15 minutes.Last night, one hour.I sent the mini sub out.They may reach it beforeit gets out of range.- Do you mind?- Okay.- Mile and a half.Is it always moving in the same direction?- No, no pattern at all.Five contacts we've made.It's neither appeared nordisappeared in the same direction.- No motors, no screws.You can rule out thesubmarine theory, Doc.- I already have.At least the conventional ones.- You know of any other kind?- No, but I thought you mightknow some new development.- (chuckling) I only wishyou had a sub like that.- I still say it's a whalelooking for a new home.- (chuckling) No, Rene.Whatever it is, it's not a whale,but it does appear to belooking for something.- How can you be socertain it's not a whale?- Same way you're so certainit's not a submarine.Marine animal's been my life's work.Let me show you.(tense music)(porpoises squealing)commander Wayne, This is Dr. Wilson.- How do you do?- Commander Wayne?- Dr. Wilson is our electronics expert.One phase of operation hereis the study of communicationand sonar techniques of marine animals.(porpoises squealing)That sound is the voicesof a school of porpoises.We've recorded a dozendifferent kinds of sea animals,including three kinds of whales.Their voices are all within therange of our ultra sensitivereceivers out there.Now,look at this.- That sound signal is inthe 100,000 cycle range,Commander.- Ultrasonics, eh?- Far beyond the range of the human ear.- Can't hear it, we can only see it.- From the mysterious object?- Far beyond the rangeof whales and porpoises.Beyond the range of any marinelife that I'm familiar with.- Now it'll move away.Seems to stop transmittingbefore it moves outta sonar range.- The object has movedaway again, Dr. LaSatier.They couldn't get closeenough to get a picture.- Maddox would be prettydisappointed if they didn't.- Maddox?- My head diver.He and our photographerare out in the mini sub.I was determined to getpictures of that thing.(tense music)(soft music)(ominous music)- [Maddox] Maddox to Sea Lab.Maddox to Sea Lab.Do you read me, over?- This is Sea Lab, we read you.Go ahead, Maddox.- [Maddox] The objectis moving away from us.I think it's some kind of submarine.Whatever it is, it's huge.Tell Dr. LaSatier we'regonna follow it, over.- He knows he can't do that.He's reaching his point of no return.- Maddox, this is Sea Lab.You know your tanks are half empty.Return to the Sea Lab at once.I repeat, return to the Sea Lab at once.You're reaching your point of no return.Am I making myself clear?- [Maddox] Your messageis very clear, doctor.Will comply.- Doctor, is that a HughMaddox you're talking to?- Yeah, it's the best engineerand diver I've ever known.You know him, Commander?- Yes, Doctor, I know him.(dramatic music)(water splashing)- We were just getting into range.- Couple of minutes more, Sandy,and we'd have been breathing the water.We were out there longer than I thought.- Well, we should havetaken the extra tanks,like I said.You're always in such a hurry.- Not always, honey.Waited 30 years for you to come along.- Then you won't mind waiting another 30.- (laughing) Sorry, sweetheart.Another two weeks towind up this operation,then we're on our way to Miami.- Got everything allfigured out, haven't you?- That's why LaSatier hired me.I'm an expert at figuring.- What did you find out?- Pictures will tellyou as much as I know.- I only got a coupleof long shots, Doctor.Unfortunately, we weren'table to move in for a closeup.- I wanna see them as soonas they're outta the soup.Don't bother to wait for 'em to dry.- Yes, sir.- Well, what do you think, Hugh?Oh, some new kind of submarine.- No, it isn't a sub.We know that.- How do we know that?- The Navy didn't waste anytime answering my request.They sent out their top submariner.I think you know him, Commander Wayne.- You're not serious.- I don't understand.- Welcome to the club, Doctor.A lot of people don'tunderstand Commander Wayne.- 70% Of the Earth'ssurface is covered by ocean.And we know less about itthan we do the surface of the moon.Every day, our crew bringsin some new form of lifeor plant like thatto be studied and classified.Forms of life in the sea are endless.- You're really seriousabout this, aren't you?- It's a serious problem.There's enough food in the oceanto supply the world's population forever.The sea is a perpetual food factory.And the specimen is underthe microscope, Commander.- Oh.Well, after a tour ofduty aboard a submarinefor a few years,a man remembers that there area lot more interesting thingsto study than seaweed.- Like women, for instance.Yes, if they look like you.- And I suppose I'm just the womanyou've been searching for.- You have a few of the qualifications.- (giggling) Why don't you try theyou've got a beautiful mind routineor the indirect approach,you know, about becoming platonic friends.- Well, somebody must havegiven you a pretty bad time.- Wrong again, Commander.I just know a lot about men.- I bet you do.- For your information, I'velived with five of them.- Oh.All at once?- Yes.I grew up with five older brothersand they taught me all the tricks.I heard it all, Commander.- [LaSatier] Commander Wayne,the photographs are ready.Will you join me in the lab please?- Right away, Doctor.Now you listen to me, beautiful.I happened to have grown upwith a couple of sisters.Let me tell you something,a brother doesn't alwaystell his sister everything.So you might have a few surprisein store for you, Doctor.Shove that under yourmicroscope and study it a while.- Commander Wayne, just one minute please.You special guest aboard Sea Lab.What you want Ho Leeto cook you for dinner?- Oh I don't know, Ho Lee,use your own discretion.- Good, good.How about porkchops?Or a big, big steak?- How about some seafood?- Good, seafood.Seafood, you mean fish?- Yeah.Fish.- How Ho Lee going to get fish?Mr. Mike.Just a minute, please.Where you go with my fish?- Your fish?What's the matter with you?These are priority specimen.- Oh, for special dinner.- Fish for dinner?Ho Lee, you better check in at sick bay.- I think this one showsmore details, Commander.- Doesn't look like anymarine animal I've ever seen.- Is it possible thatRussians have developedsome new undersea craft?- This isn't Russian.Doesn't look like a submarine at all,in the sense that we use the word.- - Well, what then?- You tell me, Doctor.I'm gonna send a communique to Washingtonand request that a navalunit be sent to this area.Meantime, I suggest that youterminate your research programuntil we can determine what this object isand what it's doing here.- Aren't you jumping to somerather hasty conclusions,Commander?We have no particular reason to suspectthat this object represents danger.- Maybe Commander Wayne isused to making hasty decisions.- Hello, Maddox.Well, you do what you wanna do, doctor,but I still think this is amatter for military authorities.- Commander, I have noobjection to your sendinga communique to the Navy department.You can make any request you wish.However, inasmuch as this isa private civilian operationunder my supervision,I do think it's up to me todecide on its termination.Not just the same as givingorders aboard the Starfish,is it, Commander?- Dr. LaSatier, it's returning.It's headed this way.(suspenseful music)- The range is two miles.- [Doctor] And closing fast.(electronic beeping)- It's at a depth of 60 feet.- If it stays on that course,it's headed directly for us.- I don't believe we haveanything to worry about.If they intended to attack us,they could have done it before.- They?- I'm receiving the signal againat a much higher frequency.- How much higher?- It's approaching a million cycles.- Don't you think you should secureall watertight doors, Doctor?- It doesn't seem to beon a collision coursenow, Commander.- Well it must have a sonar systemthat's steering it clear of us.- I was thinking about ultrasonichabitation, Dr. Wilson.- You could be right, Doctor.We're loaded with chemicals and gases,which could become irradiatedby high frequency soundwaves.- Sound emergency, sealall compartments, Maddox.(alarm blaring)- Attention all personnel,attention all personnel.This is not a drill.Go to your emergency stations.(dramatic music)(bird squawking)- Passing right over us.- Must be 50 feet in diameter.- The line's gone dead, Doctor.We're out of contact with top side.- What about the air tubes, Maddox?- Still intact.- You get scared?- A little.- It's reduced speed, it'sdropping down to the bottom.(electronic beeping)(tense music)- There's a deep trench out there.Maybe that's where it's going.- How deep?- About a mile in some places.- Maybe that explains why wehaven't detected it before.- What do you mean?- Those deep trenches,they make a pretty good place to hide.- You're inferring that they or itprefers to remain unknown.- Something like that, Doctor.They wanted to, they could havemade an official appearance.- It stopped moving.- 2000 yards.- Right at the edge of the trench.- [Man] Signal stock, Dr. LaSatier.- Now let's settle down.Dr. Wilson, let me knowif there's any change.Did you have much damage in there?- Nothing but a few frayed nerves.- Utility room from control.Is everything all rightin your area, Dr. James?- Everything except the air.It's like a wet blanket.- [LaSatier] Return to normal routine.All personnel retirefrom emergency stations,open watertight doors.Resume ventilation, Maddox.(switches flicking)- Mainline is open, pressure normal.- You better get out thereand see what's happenedto our communication lines.Take Tex along with you, right?- Right.- Commander, one of us better stay on dutythroughout the night.- I'll take the first watch, Doctor.- Right, Ho Lee willbring you some supper.- Might as well relax, Ellis.May take some time tofix those radio lines.- Yes, sir.- Guess you feel right at home down here,don't you Commander?- In a way.One big difference though.Never had women aboard a submarine.- (chuckling) Do you mind, Commander?- Mind?Best looking crew I ever served with.- What happened between you and Maddox?- Kinda like him, don't you?- I guess I do, but I reallydon't know him very well.- Well, Maddox, isn't aneasy man to know, honey.- Weren't you his commanding officer?- Executive officer.He was our chief engineer.- Why did he leave the service?- You'll have to ask him that, dear.- Something happened onboard,your submarine, didn't it?- That's right.- What?- I'd rather not discuss it.- Or maybe you're ashamed to discuss it.(tense music)(ominous music)- And in compliance with your requestfor more detailed information,I am proceeding to thearea of the unknown objectto investigate.Will report my observationsupon my return.Signed, Commander Wayne.That's about all, Ellis.Doctor, did any of the crew man volunteer?- They all did.You forget, Commander, thatour main purpose in being hereis to explore the unknown.- Good.- Maddox will go with you.- Maddox?- He's the most experienced.- I left the Starfish,I told you what would happenif I ever saw you again.- Forget it, Maddox.Forget it.- I'll never forget thatday as long as I live.I've thought about thatday for three years,over and over again.It was five men poundingand clawing at that door,trying desperately to get outof that flooding compartment.They were just kids, Wayne,and you were on theother side of that door.You didn't make a move to help 'em.- You know why I couldn't open that door.- I only know one thing,you closed that door on us andleft us to drown like rats.You think I can ever forget that?- Well, you managed to escape.You think I'll ever forget that?Listen, Ms. Welles,you're gonna stay behindme in the aquasphere.I'll take the camera.- Commander Wayne, I takemy orders from Dr. LaSatier.- Maddox, I don't knowwhat's happened in the pastbetween you and the commander,but whatever your differences,they'll have to wait untilthis operation is concluded.Is that clearly understood?- Understood.(tense music)- Good luck, Commander.- Thanks, Doctor.(electronic beeping)(water splashing)(dramatic music)(motor rumbling)(tense music)(ominous music)- Better keep your gear on.(eerie music)Must be near freezing in here.- [Maddox] What do you think?- [Wayne] This craftlooks extraterrestrial.- A spaceship?- Yeah, it's completely automated.Remotely controlled probe ship.Probably sent here to study our oceans.- Look at this.Looks like a container of some kind.- That light feels like a heat lamp.- Looks like I be ceramicor some kind of glass.- Well, whatever it is, I betit came from that compartment.- Well, it might be a fueltank that's been ejected.Cold as ice.- Maybe it's a container for specimens.They might have comehere to collect samplesof our sea life.- Hmm.- You all right?- There's somethingcreepy about this place.- Yeah.- Why don't we get back to Sea Lab?- Better leave that thing here, Maddox.- Until I hear differently,Dr. LaSatier is still incharge of this operation.He didn't send me alongjust to keep you company.(tense music)(water splashing)(counter ticking)- 35 kilocycles, really ups the sound.It's there, nonetheless.I'd say it's an instrumentpackage, Commander,but don't ask me what it's for.- Something to do with theship's guidance system.- Or power plant or observation equipment,or who knows what?- Well, there's one way to find out.Cut it open.- Now, Listen, Doctor, you're a scientist.I understand your curiosity,but I don't understand your logic.Now this ship must havetraveled through spacemillions of miles to get to this planet,obviously with a very good reason.We're dealing withsomething totally alien.That capsule, as he said,might contain just instrumentsor something simple like that.On the other hand, itmight contain somethingquite beyond the realmof our understanding.I'm fairly certain thereabout two dozen moreaboard that ship.- That's exactly the point, Commander.We're here to explore the unknown.- Now listen, Doctor.I was sent out here with the authorityto take over this project,if it became necessary.Now I don't want toexercise that authority.But until I hear from the Navy department,nobody aboard this installationis gonna tamper with that object.Do we understand each other?- I believe we do.- Good.- You might say we've been told off.- You might.- And you might say thathe's absolutely right.actually a very porous substance.It's probably a.(eerie music)- Probably a what, Rene?- Looks larger.Looks like it's growing.- It's two inches longerthan it was only an hour ago.(counter ticking)And the signal hasincreased 10,000 cycles.- Doctor, How can a matterlike that be growing?It's a solid.- Is it?- It's obviously amaterial made up of cells,and they're multiplying.Just as they do in living plant or animal.- Well then it's gottabe feeding on something.- Heat, possibly.The commander said it was very coldinside of that spacecraft.- And it might be feeding on our air.That wasn't it.Maybe it's the heat.Watch it closely.I'll be with CommanderWayne, if you need me.- Dr. Wilson, do you think that X-raywould penetrate that shell?- I don't know, but it's worth a try.(dramatic music)(glass shattering)It's almost doubled in size.(otherworldly humming)- Ultrasonic waves.- If they become intense enough,that acid bottle will shatter.Get Dr. LaSatier, hurry!(suspenseful music)(doctor screaming)(glass shattering)(container crashing)- [Man] Quick, get some gas masks!- Rene, get Dr. James.- Help.- Mike, help me get him into the berth.- Hey Maddox!Ensign for you!Hurry up, cut the ventilators.(dramatic music)(otherworldly humming)(extinguishers spraying)(suspenseful music)(creature growling)(glass shattering)(electronic beeping)- Last light, Doctor.We've gotta get everybodyoutta here, fast.- That's a watertight compartment.There's no immediate danger.- That's not what I mean.- Where's Tex?- He's in there.Wait a minute, Maddox.Don't go in there.- Why not?- There's something in there.- What?- Some kind of an amphibiousanimal come outta that capsule.It attacked Tex, I couldn't get him out.- Outta my way.- Listen to me.(fists punching)- Break it up.Break it up.All right, cut it out, both of you.You know you can't open that door, Maddox.You wanna flood the whole Sea Lab?- There should have been plenty of timefor both of them to get out.He's a real pro at leaving men trappedin flooding compartments.- I told you it attacked Tex.There was nothing I could do about it.- You expect anyone to believe that?- I don't give a damn what you believe.(creature smashing)(dramatic music)(alarm blaring)Better radio for helpbefore it's too late, Doc.- Amphibious animals.(receiver tapping)- Skipper, there's somethingwrong with the linesof the Sea Lab.Top side to Sea Lab, top side to Sea Lab.Are you receiving?Are you receiving, over?(suspenseful music)Lines are dead, Skipper.- You're using the hydroponic transmitter?- Sea Lab to top side.Are you receiving me?- This is top side.Go ahead, Sea Lab.- Attention, top side.This is Commander Wayne.Send this message.Office of Naval Operations, Washington,Attention Admiral Bradford, urgent.(monster smashing)(man screaming)(water splashing)Request you send surfaceunits to this area immediatelyequipped with depth charges and.- Would you repeat?Would you repeat?(monster growling)- [Wayne] AttentionAdmiral Bradford, urgent.Request you send demolitionunits to this area immediatelyto destroy submerged spacecraft.End of message.(creature roaring)(man screaming)Hello, top side.Please repeat that message.Hello, top side, top side?This is Commander Wayne,please repeat the message.Hello, top side.Please repeat the message.Hello, top side.Please repeat the message.- Monster seems determined to isolate us.- Or annihilate us.Doctor, I think you betterclose those window guards.If that thing can breakout, it can break in.- You think it'll try to attack us?- Doctor, I think that thingwill do everything it canto try to prevent anyone fromknowing of its existence.- Maybe it's not asdangerous as you think.Maybe it's more afraid of usthan we appear to be of it.Any animal will defend itself, Commander,especially a primitive one.- One thing I'm certain of, doctor,that thing is not primitive.I bet you it's a lotsmarter than both of us.- But that's all the more reasonwe should try to communicate with it.(Rene screaming)(suspenseful music)(gate slamming)- Well, you still think it'sfrightened of us, Doctor?- I had no idea.Do you realize the importanceof this phenomenon, Commander?- I realize that danger we're in.Anything at all, Ellis?- No, sir.Something must've happenedto their equipment.- More likely something happened to them.(alarm blaring)- That's why.The surface pumps have stopped.- How long will theemergency air supply last?- About 12 hours.A little longer if we're conservative.- Dr. Wilson has a severecerebral hemorrhage.We'll have to get himinto a hospital at once.- There's nothing we can do about it.We've lost contact with the surface crew.- I don't understand.Can't somebody go outand see what's wrong?- We know what's wrong, Dr. James,we just don't know exactlywhat to do about it.- If you don't hearfrom me within an hour,we'll know there's nothingwe can do about it.Ellis, stand by that receiver.Oh, Mike, get me one of yourbest spear guns, will ya?- You can't go out therealone, that's suicide.- Do you know what thisplace is gonna be likein about 12 hours after the air gives out?- When the air gives out?- Pumps are out, we'reon the emergency tanks.(locker slamming)- Now listen,Tell Dr. James to have Dr. Wilson ready.I'm gonna try to getthe diving bell working.- Commander, you cannotgo out there alone.- I'm pretty good withthese things, Commander.- Okay, Mike.(suspenseful music)(creature roaring)Watch it, Mike!Watch it!- Help!(Sandra screaming)- Maddox, flood this hatch.Doc!- Take it easy, Mike.Let's get him in the infirmary.- All right.(somber music)(tense music)What time does the supplyvessel arrive tomorrow?- Usually arrives about noon.- We'll never hold out that long.- Even if we could hold out,I don't know what they could do for us.- We're gonna have to closeup more compartments, Doctor.- We're down to the minimum now.- What about the biology lab?- Commander Wayne,that lab is full ofvaluable marine specimens,most of which will die without air.- So will we.Maddox,close off the biology lab.Close it off!And we can close off the infirmary too.We can move Mike, Dr. Jamesand Dr. Wilson in here.- Commander, Dr. Wilsonno longer needs any air.(door knocking)- Well, how is he?Any better?- Worse.Fever's gone up.- Well,a scratch, it doesn't look that bad.- No, it's more than that.- What's that, from the amphibian?- Mm hm.A carrier of some kind of unknown disease,unknown to me anyway.- Maybe that explains itsreason for being here.- Trying to escape a plaguethat's threatening to wipeout its own civilization.- It's a possibility.Is that contagious?- I don't know.I've prepared a serum that might help,but I don't know.If it is contagious,that one creature couldstart a major epidemic.- Well, imagine what a dozen might do.Uh, have you found whatyou're looking for?- Mm hm.- Any of the rest of 'em know about this?- Do you think they should?It's enough to worry about already.How much time do youthink we have, Commander?- I don't know.Roughly, I'd say eight hours.- Well, I know you'll doeverything humanly possible.- Doctor, I think you betterinoculate the rest of the crew.They don't have to know what it is,tell 'em it's a tetanus shot or something.- If you flex your musclemore, it won't hurt so much.- Thank you, nurse.(spear clattering)- You no like blackdragon tea, Miss Sandra?- No like.- No like.- How many spear guns do we havein the utility room, Maddox?- Oh, about half a dozen.- Good, I want you to gimme a handwith the welding equipment.You too, Ellis.- Yes, sir.- We're gonna set a trap, Doctor.- We're the ones in a trap,like rats and a sinking ship,if you know what I mean, Commander.- You know, I've just abouthad it with you, Maddox.You wanna go into this thing?Okay, let's go into it.- Now, What's that supposed to mean?- You know what it means.When are you gonna quitlying to yourself anyway?Don't you think I knowwhat really happenedaboard the Starfish.- Are you trying to say you didn't lock usin that forward room?- No, I admit that.I had no choice.It was either seal off thatroom or flood the entire ship.- Sure, and left us to drownin a flooded compartment.- You managed to escape, Maddox.Why couldn't the others?- You don't know whatyou're talking about.- Oh yes I do.There was an escape chamberthat compartment, Maddox.There was a chance forevery one of those mento get out of there.I knew that when I sealed offthat room, they knew it too.But something went wrong, didn't it?You panicked, didn't you?- You are crazy.- Am I?You got in that escapechamber first, Maddox.There was a chance for everyman to get in that chamber.But you got got there first, didn't you?And you slammed thathatch on 'em, didn't you?- Sure, sure, I got there first,but they didn't follow me.They were trying to getout that door you closed.- That's a damn lie,Maddox, and you know it!You once told me how younever could forget the facesof those five men, how theyclawed and pounded on that door,trying desperately to escape.How could you know that, Maddox,if you were inside that escape chamber?I'll tell you how,because it was the escape chamberthey were trying to get into.You could see them throughthe window of the hatch.Yes, You could see their faces, Maddox.Just kids, remember?Crying out to you for help.But you didn't make a move.- You're lying to cover up for yourself.- Am I?Then how come we found the escape chamberlocked from the inside when wefinally brought the Starfishto the surface?And why did we find two of those menwith their broken, bloodyfingers still clingingto the outside of that hatch?- I don't know!- Yes you do, Maddox!- No I don't!- Listen to me.Every man gets scared sometime, someplace.Every man has their breaking point.You can stand just somuch and then you crack.Now you're no less a man for that, Maddox.But listen to me, you're gonna be a man.You're gonna stand upright now and admit itor else you're through.Now spit it out!- When Igot into the escape chamber,something inside me snapped.I slammed the hatch and locked it.And then I froze.I could see them, thosekids trying to get in,but I couldn't move.I killed 'em, Commander.I didn't mean to.I was a.That's why I left the service.After that, I couldn't standto look the rest of the crewin the eye.I didn't have the gutsto admit I was a coward.- No one's calling you a coward, Maddox.(hand patting)Come on now.Give me a hand, we haven't got much time.(solemn music)- You know something, Hugh?Until a minute ago. Icouldn't find much in youI really liked.Now, I think I couldfall in love with you.Come on.Commander Wayne needs your help.(dramatic music)- Everything okay, Doctor?- Okay.We're ready.- Good, now be very carefulof these trigger lines.Everybody clear the room.Don't come back til I give you the signal.Batten down those hatches behind you.I said everybody clear the room.(crowbar scraping)(crowbar tapping)(suspenseful music)- What he trying to do?- He's using himself as bait.(water splashing)(creature roaring)- Get back!Probably woundedEllis, gimme a hand.- What do you intend doing?- I'm going after it.We'll never get outtahere til it's finished.(sonar beeping)(tense music)(dramatic music)(water splashing)(ominous music)- Let's suit up, Ellis.- Yes, sir.(solemn music)(eerie music)(suspenseful music)(creature roaring)- You've got to get itto the Marine Instituteas soon as possible.- Welcome back on board again, Maddox.- Forget it.You looked a little short on crew.- Okay, hit it withthose tranquilizers, Doc,and keep him knocked out.He still has a lot of fight in him.Let's get to the surface andget the air pump started.Ellis, stand by the hydrophones.Be ready to leaveas soon as we get thedining bell operating.Remember, keep this hatch secure.(creature groaning)- One shot will be enough.Anymore might kill him.He's near enough death now.- But Doctor, the commander said--- Commander Wayne is notinterested in scientific research.I am.(dramatic music)- Let's get this gear off.(tanks crashing)Listen,you see if you can get the pump started.I'll check the radio shack.Go ahead.(suspenseful music)(somber music)We're too late, Hugh, he's dead.- Well, the air pumps are okay,but he's fouled up thewinch in the hoisting crane.We can't operate the bell.- Are there any explosive on this barge?- Might be.They used dynamite toclear away the coral headswhen they were building the aquasphere.Why?- Won't be able to contact the Navyuntil the supply shiparrives in the morning.That might be too late.- You're thinking about theother capsules on the spaceship.- That's right.Let's see if we can find that dynamite.(ominous music)(water splashing)Two of these oughta beenough to blow this, Maddox.- Sandy,get the automatic timer fromthe photographic enlargerand bring it to the mess hall.(tense music)(compartment sliding)- Do you really thinkyou're doing the right thinghere, Commander?I mean, don't you think weshould take the opportunityof studying this entirephenomenon before it's destroyed?- Doc, do you think thebest way to prevent a waris to wait until theenemy drops a bomb on you?- I mean, we reallyhaven't tried to understandits purpose in coming here.- Doc, maybe you haven'tthought about this,but wherever this thing came from,land animals like ourselvescould be its natural enemies.Maybe it's here trying toavoid the destruction by man.Well, whatever it is, we can'tafford to take any chances.Let's go.Ellis, get some morechains, bind its legs.Now, if I were you people,I'd stay far away from this thing.That means all of you.(chains rattling)- Not this time, Sandy.I mean it.- You might need help.- I said no.I'm sorry about the way things turned out.- It doesn't matter.I told you that.- Matters to me.It matters to you too, you know it.We can never have anything together now.- Don't you.- Every time I'd look at you,I'd be reminded of the coward in me.- It's over.Don't torture yourself.- No it isn't.Maybe it'll never be over.When this mission's finished,I'm going away somewherenew and get a fresh start.- That won't be so easy, Hugh.- Maybe not,but facing you and the others,that's not easy either.It's the only way for me, Sandy.You know that.- [Wayne] Are you ready, Maddox?(air hissing)(water splashing)(tense music)(water splashing)- Wait a minute.(motor whirring)(air hissing)(eerie music)(suspenseful music)(ominous music)(Rene screaming)(creature roaring)(crowbar crashing)- No, Doctor, stay away!(creature roaring)- Ellis!Ellis, call Commander Wayneand tell him the amphibian has escaped.Hurry!- - I can't.The hydrophones won't work now.(electronic beeping)(suspenseful music)(tense music)(suspenseful music)- All right, we've gotabout three minutes.(water splashing)(Sandra screaming)(creature roaring)- Get ready to make arun for it, both of you.- No, no!- Get back!(creature roaring)(tense music)- Now, hurry!- No, don't!- Wayne, get here whileyou still got a chance.- Come on, put these on.(gun firing)(ominous music)(creature groaning)- [Maddox] Get over here!(water splashing)(box clattering)(flare whooshing)(creature roaring)(bomb exploding)(dramatic music)(solemn music)(tense music)(bell ringing)- Mike's on his way toMiami by Naval helicopter.The others are waitingaboard a supply ship.Where's Dr. LaSatier?- He's in a control room.He's pretty upset about having to leave.- Well, he won't be when hehears the news from Washington.Well, ready to go, Doctor.- Commander, I think I oughtstay here and supervisethe repair operation.- Well, I don't think thatheadquarters would like that.- Headquarters?I don't understand.- Well, I contacted the Naval Departmentfrom the supply ship,gave 'em a full report.The news reached thepresident within minutes.He's expecting you at the White Housefor a press conference as soonas a plane can get you there.- What am I gonna tell him?We destroyed the firstcreature from another world.- It had to be done,Doctor, you realize that.- I realize it.I also realize how littlewe know of any other worldexcept our own.It's ironic.Here we are all set to putmen on totally alien planets.And we're completely unequippedto understand a creaturefrom one of those planets.That amphibian was our ultimateopportunity, and we failed.We don't know any more nowthan we did before it arrived.- You're wrong, Doctor.We now know that somewhere in space,there's a civilization of beings equal to,if not superior to ourselves.We never knew that for certain before.We also know that somehowwe have to find a wayto communicate with those beings,if we ever encounter them again.That's what you have to tell 'emat the press conference, Doc,that you are the one man withthe knowledge and experienceto find that way.That you are ready to tacklethe most important researchprogram of our age.- Commander, don't youthink we're being a littleinconsiderate keepingthe president waiting?(light music)- Did anyone ever tellyou you're quite a guy?- Oh no, that's not avery novel approach, Rene.Why don't you try the,oh, you're just the kind ofman I've been looking for oneor perhaps the platonicfriendship approach.- You think you know it all, don't you?- Oh, I know a little.- Well, Commander,you still may have a fewsurprises in store for you.- Really?Like what.- The direct approach.(romantic music)(upbeat music)"

        THE SACRIFICECome here and give me a hand, my boy!Once upon a time, long ago...an old monk livedin an orthodox monastery.His name was Pamve.And once he planted a barren treeon a mountainsidejust like this.Then he told his young pupil,a monk named Ioann Kolov,that he should water the treeeach day until it came to life.Put a few stones there, will you?



Anyway, early every morningIoann filled a bucketwith water and went out.He climbed up the mountainand watered the withered treeand in the eveningwhen darkness had fallenhe returned to the monastery.He did this for three years.And one fine day, he climbedup the mountain and sawthat the whole treewas covered with blossoms!Say what you will, but a method,a system, has its virtues.You know, sometimes I say to myself,if every single day,at exactly the samestroke of the clock,one were to performthe same single act,like a ritual,



unchanging, systematic,every day at the same time,the world would be changed.Yes, something would change.It would have to.One could wake upin the morning, let's say,get up at exactly seven,go to the bathroom,pour a glass of water from the tap,and flush it down the toilet.Only that!You can't keep me away today!Beautiful, eh?Like Japanese Ikebana.I will come to your houseto wish you wellon your birthday.I am very honoured by the invitation!Here's the last of it.The post office is closed.Anyone who turns up now will justhave to wait until tomorrow. Here!I don't have my glasses.Please read it.""HAPPY BIRTHDAYDEAR FRIEND STOPMIGHTY RICHARD GREETSGOOD PRINCE MYSCHKIN STOPGOD GRANT YOU JOYHEALTH AND PEACE STOPFROM YOUR LOYAL AND LOVINGRICHARDIANS AND IDIOTISTS STOP""Oh, how touching!A joke.Friends and their jokes!""Idiotists..."" That's not half bad.""God grant you joy...""Say, how are your relations with God?Non-existent, I'm afraid.What do you mean?It could be worse.Here you are...a famous journalist,a theatrical and literary critic,who lectures on aestheticsfor students at the university.Hey, your lasso! Run and fetch it!And essays...you write them, too.But you're so gloomy!What's that supposedto mean, ""gloomy""?Well, you shouldn't grieve so much.You shouldn't yearn so for something.You shouldn't be waiting like that.That's important.One shouldn't be waitingfor something.""Shouldn't be waiting""?Who says I'm waiting for anything?We all are... waiting for something!Take me, for example.All my life, I've been goingaround waiting for something.All my life, in fact,I've felt as if...as if I were waitingin a railway station.And I've always felt as if...as if the living I've done so farhasn't actually been real lifebut a long wait for it...a long wait for something real,something important!What about you?Yes, if that's what you mean.I just never knew you wereinterested in that kind of problem.But I am! I most certainly am!Unfortunately.Sometimes I getthe most peculiar notions.Yes, I mean it.Like that dwarf, for example.That notorious dwarf!What dwarf?Look here, you've managedto confuse me completely!Oh, you know who I mean!That hunchback!Eh? The one Nietzsche mentioned.The one who made Zarathustra faint.Faint? What are you talking about?I say, do you know Nietzsche?No, not personally.I haven't really studied himall that carefully.However...he interests me, I can't deny it.So?Sometimes I get silly thingsin my head, things like...like this ""eternal rotation"".We live, we have our ups and downs.We hope.We wait for something.We hope, we lose hope,we move closer to death.Finally, we dieand are born again.But we remember nothing.And everything begins again,from scratch.Not literally the same way,just a wee, wee bit different.But it's still so hopeless...and we don't know why.Yes...No, I mean...Really, it's quite the same,literally, the same.Just the next performance,so to speak.If I'd made it all, I guessI'd have done things the same way.Funny, eh?I've heard that, it's nothing new.You didn't invent it!Do you really think that mankindcould devise a universal concept,a model, so to speak,of Absolute Law, of Absolute Truth?Why, it'd be like tryingto create a new universe!To be a demiurge!And you actually believe in yourdwarf, do you? In your ""rotation""?Yes...Sometimes I do.You understand?If I truly believe,it will be so.""Believe that it hath been givenand it shall be given unto you.""But now I think I'll head home.It's late, I must think of a gift.You needn't do that.This is a very important day!You'll be buried in telegrams!Au revoir!What?What are you mumbling about?""In the beginning was the Word.""But you are mute, mute as a fish.A little roach!Look here, my boy,we've lost our way.Humanity is also on the wrong road,a dangerous road.So, up you go!Dear, how heavy you are.The first impression that Man had...How has he been lately? All right?Yes.In what way? He works a lot.I don't like his monologues.Alexander!Doctor! Wait, we'll come to you!You're not equippedfor a jaunt through Africa!It's quite a job, you know!- Hello.- Hello! Welcome!- Many happy returns!- Thanks, thanks!And you, young man, how are you?Isn't it hard to keep silent?I can well imagine.But it's good for you.Sociability is a burden.Not all of us can bear it.- My brave boy!- Why ""my""? He's ""ours"", after all.He garglesand goes to bed by himself.Gargles? That's nothing!Think how well he behavedduring the operation!He's got the makings of a real man!Open wide, now!It looks fine. Keep that upand you'll be talking in a week.By the way, did you knowthat Gandhi had one day in the weekwhen he spoke to no one?- It was his system.- Why?He was probably tired of people.Shall we walk here?You've deserted your patients.And what elegance!On a day like this,one has to live up to expectations!Your present's in the boot.Still more presents!- It's time we went home.- Yes, all of us.But why don't you two take the car?We'll follow on foot.We must finish our chat.Right, my boy?Please don't be too late.All right, Little Man?Everything's almost ready.Have I told you how your motherand I found this place?We came here on a trip, once.You weren't even thought of then.It was the first time we were here.We had no map with us,we forgot to bring one.Besides, we'd run out of petrol.We stopped somewhere near here,then we kept going on foot.Frankly, we were lost.Then it started raining,a cold, ugly drizzle.We came to that bend over there,by that dry, old pine treeand just then, the sun came out.It stopped raining.The light was dazzling!Then we saw the house.Suddenly I was sad that I didn't...I mean, that we didn't live therein that house under the pines,so close to the sea.How beautiful it was!I knew that if I lived there,I'd be happy until I died.Hm? What's wrong? Don't be afraid.There is no such thing as death.No, there's the fear of death,and that is an awful fear.Sometimes it even makes peopledo things they shouldn't.But how different things would beif only we could stop fearing death!Huh? Oh, I was talkingabout something else... Ah, yes.As I was saying, we were enchantedas we took in the beauty of it.We couldn't tear ourselves away.The peace, the stillness...And...it was plain that this housewas meant just for us.It turned out to be for sale, too.What a miracle!And you were born in this house.Do you like it?Do you like it, your house?Eh, my boy?Man has defended himself, alwaysagainst other men, against Nature.He has constantly violated Nature.The result is a civilisation builton force, power, fear, dependence.All our ""technical progress""has only provided uswith comfort, a sort of standard.And instruments of violenceto keep power. We are like savages!We use the microscope like a cudgel!No, that's wrong.Savages are more spiritual than us!As soon as we makea scientific breakthroughwe put it to usein the service of evil.And as for the standard,some wise man once saidthat sinis that which is unnecessary.If that is so,then our entire civilisationis built on sin,from beginning to end.We have acquireda dreadful disharmonyan imbalance, if you will,between our materialand our spiritual development.Our culture is defective.I mean, our civilisation.Basically defective, my boy!Perhaps you meanthat we ought to study the problemand look for a solution together.Perhaps we could, if it wasn'tso late. Altogether too late.God, how weary I am of this talk!""Words, words, words!""At last, I know what Hamlet meant.He was fed up with windbags.And so am I. Why do I talk this way?If only someone could stop talkingand DO something instead!Or at least try to.Little Man!Little Man!Dear God, what's wrong with me?Fantastic!Such remarkable refinement!Such wisdom and spirituality!Also such pure, childlike innocence.At once profound, yet virginal.It's unbelievable!Like a prayer.And all this has been lost.We can't even pray any longer.I had a rotten day today.Or rather, a day I lost control of.Thank you, Victor.A splendid book!Thanks for the wine, too.We'll have it later.Above all, thanks for coming!Have you...never feltthat your life was a failure?No. Why?I once felt exactly that way.But since Little Man came along,all that has changed.Not all at once, of course.A bit at a time as he grew bigger.I'm very attached to him,too much, I'm afraid.But there is somethingin all this that I resent.I prepared myself for a life,a higher life, so to speak.I studied philosophy,the history of religion, aesthetics.And I ended upputting myself in chains,of my own free will.But at the same time, I'm happy.Today, for example...What happened today?I got a telegram from my friends.As a joke, they signed it:""Richardians and Idiotists"".Old theatre friends. We playedShakespeare and Dostoyevsky.- I remember!- No!- Remember what?- Those performances.- Oh, come now!- Yes, I do!I remember how you droppedthat vase from the tray and broke it!And your eyes were full of tears.I remember it well.The vase, too.It was white, with blue flowers.That's right! She does remember!But those tears meant nothing.I had something in my eye.It hurt so, I didn't thinkI'd get through the performance.Alexander was superbas Prince Myschkin.That role made you!And then you just gave it all up.The theatre, the lot!You threw away everythingafter Richard III and The Idiot.I don't know why.- What ""everything""?- Hm?What do you mean by ""everything""?The theatre.Everything!""Success"", that's what you mean!As it happens,theatre isn't ""everything""!I couldn't take it any more.What do you mean?Well...For some reason, I startedfeeling embarrassed on stage.I was ashamed to impersonate someoneelse, to play others' emotions.But worst of all, I was ashamedof being honest on stage.It was a critic who first saw that.But it wasn't sudden, not at all.So you mean that an actormay not keep his ego intact?That he must lose his identity?No, not quite.What I mean is that an actor'sidentity dissolves in his roles.I didn't want my ego dissolved.There was something in itthat struck me as sinful,something feminine and weak.Aha! Feminine!So that's what's sinful!I liked you as an actor, so you quit.That's it!- I don't know. That might be it.- No, that was it!I said it might be.- Always the last word!- She'll be the death of him!Please, not today!It's Alexander's birthday!Thanks for defending me, Victor.In other words,first he seduced me with his acting.Then he lured me from Londonand abandoned me!But I liked beingthe great actor's wife.Forgive me, but I saw no harm in it!Who's that, now?By the way, Alexander,I'll soon be leaving.Leaving?Leaving all this.Has something happened?I've been offered a clinicin Australia.Are you serious?You must tell me about it later.It's Otto, the postman.He's carrying something!Julia! Your beau's come calling!Good evening!- Many happy returns!- Thanks.Here I am, and here'sa kind of present for you.Thank you very much! What is it?I don't think I can do this alone.It's a map of Europe,from the late 1 600s.Is it genuine?How could it be?It must be a copy, a reproduction.No, not at all!It's genuine, an original!- How could anyone...- Is it possible?How beautiful it is!We must take it inside. Come, now!But it's far too dear a gift.I don't know if I...Oh, God, don't say that!But it's far too much!Too much, Otto!I know it's no sacrifice, but...And why shouldn't it be?Of course it's a sacrifice!Every gift involves a sacrifice.If not, what kind of giftwould it be?Excuse me...Otto. My name is Otto.Oh.Excuse me, Otto.What are you doing in these parts?I hear you haven't lived here long.Smoke?Once I went to the morgueand saw the autopsied corpse...of a man who had smokedall his life. I saw his lungs.I haven't smoked since.Hear that, Alexander?Yes, you're absolutely right.I've only lived here two months.Before then, I taught historyat a secondary school.But when I took my pension,I moved here.And here I am.Nowadays, I have fewer expensesand more time for my interests.My sister used to live here.She's dead now.I understand you're employedby the post office.Yes, I'm a postman.But not regularly.Only in my spare time.Hello, Maria!I've put everything in order,Mrs Adelaide. Can I go now?Yes, yes, Maria. Thank you.Oh, yes! Do you thinkyou might just warm the plates?Julia can do the rest.Yes, Mrs Adelaide.I'll put the plates to warm at once.I'll warm the plates. Then can I go?Is there anything more?No, no! You may go.Julia's still here.Oh, one more thing!Would you put the candleson the table?Then you may go... You haveopened the wine, haven't you?Well, open it.Then you won't be needed.The plates, the candles, the wine.We're neighbours, she and I.We're acquainted.Indeed? Congratulations.She came from Icelanda few years ago.Really?She is very odd.Who?Maria.Yes, Maria.Sometimes she scares me.It must've been lovely when menthought the world looked like this!This Europe looks more like Mars.That is, it has nothingto do with truth.No! But people lived then!And not badly, either.But wait, what's the date......today?1392...It's best we put the map away now.Otto, will you help me?I have a feeling that our maps havenothing to do with truth, either.What truth?You keep going on about truth.- Truth! What is truth?- There's no such thing!We look, but don't see.Here comes a cockroach...A cockroach!Par exemple, madame!Excusez-moi!Here comes a cockroachrunning 'round a plate.He fancies that he's moving forwardwith a definite purpose.How do you knowwhat a cockroach thinks?It could be a ritual.- Yes!- His own.Aha. ""Could be.""Anything could be.""Could be""!Otherwise, all we're left withis this ""truth"", ""truth"".- Can I help?- No, that's fine.Let's put it there, Otto.A fantastic map!I'm glad you think so.It's a first class chart.Where's Little Man?Where's the boy?I don't know.He was here just a moment ago.- Shall I look?- No, no.He seemed down to me.- Something wrong?- I'll be right back.Dinner's ready.You said you had more timefor your interests...What did you mean?Huh?Take it easy.I think I saw him a moment ago.- I'm sort of a collector.- Are you?What do you mean, ""sort of""?How shall I put it?I collect incidents.Things that are unexplainablebut true.I need a lot of time, though,to gather evidence that they're true.I need to travel, too,and I need money for it.That's why I'm a postman... as well.Unexplainable?Little Man should be here.He loves stories like this.Does he, indeed?But still...I don't really understand.Well, for example...No, not that one.How about this one...It happened before the war.In K?nigsberg,a widow was living with her son.But then war broke out, and the boywas drafted. He was 1 8 years old.They decided to see a photographerand have a keepsake photo taken.The mother and her sonwere photographed together.Then the boy...the boy was sent off...to the front.A few days later, he was killed.Good Lord!In the midstof all the commotion and calamitythe widow, of course,forgot about the photos.""Of course""? Why,how could she forget such a thing?- It's not important.- No, it's not very important at all.The fact is, this womannever collected the photographs.The war ended. She moved to anothertown, far from her memories.But didn't she even tryto find the photographer?It was her last photo of her son!But do let him make his point!Sorry.- Mummy...!- I'll be quiet. Sorry!It doesn't matter.Some years later...I think it was in 1 9 60...the widow visited a photographerto have her own photo taken.She intended to give it to a friend.The photo was taken,but when she got the printsshe saw not only herself on them,but her dead son, too.In the photos, he was 18and she was as old as she waswhen these last photos were taken.Did it happen like that?Just as you told us?Yes. That's how it happened.How did you check it?I've spoken with the woman.And I have the photoshowing her in 1960and her son in a 1940s uniform.Oh, dear God!And besides...I have a copyof his birth certificateand an official copyof the notice of death.Are you pulling our leg?No, by no means!I have about 300 similar incidents.284, to be exact.We are simply blind.We see nothing.What was that? What do you think?Are you ill?No...nothing's wrong.It was only an evil angel passing by,who saw fit to touch me.And you see fit to joke with us, eh?Mr Postman?There are jokes and JOKES, Doctor.There's nothing to joke about here.""Which of you have done this?""""The Lords...?""Maria!Who made that?Little Man.Little Man, really?- Where is he?- He's upstairs.I think he's in his room.That's good.But what is it?He made it for you.It's his birthday present to you.It was he and Otto, the postman,who built it together.Don't say that I told you,Mr Alexander.He wanted to show it off himself.I'll go now.Many happy returns!Go home now! It's so damp out.- May I come in?- Yes, come in!Oh, it's you. Come in!Things are almost ready downstairs.What on earth's that?What's what?The picture, there.On the wall. What is it?I can't see it clearly.It's behind glass and it's so dark.It's the Adorationof the Three Kingsby Leonardo.A reproduction, of course.My God, how sinister it is!I've always been terrifiedof Leonardo....are now beingorganised nationwide...This is even the dutyof all officers in the army.Every responsible citizen...is expected to behavewith courage...to keep a cool head...and to help the army...in its effortsto re-establish peace,order, and discipline.The only dangerous enemyin our midst at the moment,is panic.It is contagious,and won't allow itselfto be ruled by common sense.Order and organisation...and nothing less, good Citizens!Only order... order...against this chaos.I beg you, I humbly appealto your courage and...in spite of all...to your common sense.Shall we eat? And wake the boy?We have here, unfortunately...such a base,with four missile warheads...And it is very likely...that these warheads,tragically enough...What's this?... will be used against us.Communications may be brokenat any time...but I have told youwhat is most important......my fellow citizens.You are to stay where you are.There is no place in all of Europe...that is saferthan where we are now.In this regard,we are all forcedinto the same situation.All districts will beunder the controlof special military units...so that... so that...Surely, this isn't...!Shouldn't one do something?I've waited for this all my life.My whole life has beenone long wait, for this!Don't touch me! Do something!You men!Why don't you say something?Can't we do something?Mama, please calm down!My God!Victor!At least you could do something!Please!The boy is asleep.He mustn't be awakened!It's all my fault!This is my punishment!The boy's sleeping.Don't wake him.- Little Man! Where is he?- He's asleep.Julia! Go get Little Man!Alexander,don't you even understand?Julia!Fetch the black bag by the piano.Maybe later.Oh, God!Put it on the table.Alexander!I can't bear it any more!Please, please!Julia, do you need one, too?No, I don't want it!It's not necessary.Yes, it is.It's absolutely necessary.And it's completely harmless.It will be easierfor all of us if you take it.No! I don't want to!- And you, Alexander?- No, I'll have a drink instead.Just don't drink too much.It'll only make it worse.Otto?Oh, no, don't worry.Thanks, but I don't need it.Julia!We must go up to the boy.He's not to wake up, now!I'll go with you.Julia can stay with Mama.Sleep now, sleep.We'll be right back.It's dead.The telephone's dead.Oh, dear God...Why do we always dothe opposite of what we want?Always!I have loved one man...and married another.Why?Would you like something to drink?No, no!Nothing! Thanks, Otto.No.I think I know, now.We simply don't wantto depend on anyone.When two people love each other,they don't love in the same way.One of them is strong,the other, weaker.And the weaker is always the onewho loves without reckoning...without reservation.It feels now as if I've awakenedfrom some kind of dream...after some other kind of life.For some reason,I always offered resistance.I fought against something.I defended myself,just as though I'd had...someone else inside me, saying:Don't give in to anything...don't go along with...anything......or you'll die!But God, how foolish we are anyway!That's good.It's goodthat you finally understood that.How do you feel?- Better now?- Yes.I've finally understood,even though it's a bit late.But what shall we do now?The telephone isn't working,of course.We could get into the carand drive north,where it's quieter...But it's no use.No. It's the same everywhere.And no one knows where it's worst.No, no! We'll stay here.There, there...Easy, easy...We won't go anywhere.We're staying here.Victor!And now...Now we shall eat dinner!Excuse me, but I must go now.I have a few things to put in order.What will you do, Martha?Julia.Go wake Little Man!Today is a very special day.We must be together.Please stop it!Julia, did you hear me?- It's best not to wake him.- Julia!I'm not going to wake him!I don't intend to!And I won't allowanyone else to, either!He's asleep now,and we mustn't wake him,or frighten him.A lot can happenwhile he's sleeping.If God will, he'll never knowwhat's happened.Don't scare him!Please, I beg you!If you have to torture someone,let it be Mr Alexander!Or me, for that matter!Choose whom you will,since you can't do otherwise!But I will not allow youto torture the boy!My dear girl...My poor, dear girl...Forgive me!Our Father, who...Our Father, who art in Heaven...hallowed be Thy Name.Thy Kingdom come...Thy will be done...Give us this day our daily bread...And deliver us from evil.For Thine is the Kingdom...and the Power...and the Glory.Amen.Lord!Deliver us in this terrible time.Don't let my children die,or my friends...my wife...Victor...all those who love Theeand believe in Thee...All those who do not believe in Thee,because they are blind...Those who haven'tgiven Thee a thought...simply because they haven't yetbeen truly miserable.All those who in this hourhave lost their hope, their future...their lives...and the opportunityto surrender to Thy will.All those who are filled with dreadwho feel the End coming closer...who fear, not for themselves,but for their loved ones.All those whom no one,except Thou, can offer protection.Because this war is the ultimate war,a horrible thing.And after it, there will beno victors and no vanquished...no cities or towns, grass or trees,water in the wells,or birds in the sky.I will give Thee all I have.I'll give up my family, whom I love.I'll destroy my home,and give up Little Man.I'll be mute, and never speakanother word to anyone.I will relinquish everythingthat binds me to life...if only Thou dost restoreeverything as it was before...as it was this morning and yesterday.Just let me be rid of...this deadly...sickening, animal fear!Yes, everything!Lord!Help me.I will do everythingI have promised Thee.Come here, Victor!Help me!My boy!- What is it?- Sorry to get you up.- Were you asleep?- What is it? What's happened?There's still one last chance!A chance? What kind of chance?A chance! One last hope!What kind of hope?What's the matter with you?Nothing's the matter with me.But Maria can do it! Maria!Maria?Which Maria? Do what?You must go to her and convince her.Do you understand?Where must I go?Whom must I convince?Come in, have a drink.I had one and I feel better.There's no light any more.How long have I slept?You shouldn't drink thatby the glassful.It's very good cognac, that!Where is everybody?Are they sleeping?They're downstairs,sitting 'round the table.- They're very fond of you.- Sitting 'round what table?You must go to Maria at once!Which Maria?Can't you express yourselfmore clearly?Maria, you know her!One of your servant girls.Yes, yes, yes!I'll explain later.Don't rush me!Who's rushing you, for God's sake!Why do you alwayshave to beat about the bush?She lives...on a farmon the other side of the bay.Behind the church.It's closed now.Who?""Who""?I'm not talking about ""who"".I mean the church.But I asked who lives there.What's the church got to do with it?Who lives there?Why, Maria, of course.Your servant. I've been tryingto tell you that for half an hour!Can't you pay more attention?This is very important!Pay attention? I...I know where she lives.My wife showed me.Oh, I think that... I...Yes, it's quite all right.It's all right, believe me.I'll sit here by you.What was it you saidabout the servant?Oh, yes, your servant girl...- Did you hear?- Hear what?What was that?I don't know... I don't know.I thought it sounded like music.In any case, you must go to Maria!But why?Don't you want all of thisto be over and done with?For what to be done with?Everything!The whole lot!God, Otto!There is an end to this!Otto!Yes!You must go to Mariaand lie with her.What?I say, you must goand lie with Maria!Lie with Maria?It's very simple. She lives alone.And if you only wishfor one thing at that moment:That all this will be over,then it will be!There'll be no more of it!But that's madness, Otto!Good God, Otto!You don't understand a thing!It's true!It's a holy truth.She has very special qualities,you know.I've gathered evidence.She is a witch!In what sense?In the best sense!Are you joking again?Still having me onwith your Nietzschean pranks?Is there any other way out?There is no other alternative.None whatsoever!What alternative, Otto?What are you talking about?It's best if I go now.I've left the bike for you...down there by the shed.Don't take the car, they'll hear you.I've put a ladderagainst the balcony.Go to Maria...but be careful!There are a couple of broken spokesin the front wheel.I once caught my trouser leg in them.I almost fell in the water.- What trouser leg?- The right one.Be careful!Have you finally understoodwhat I told you?Do you hear what I'm saying?Yes, what about it?No... Never!Anyway, I preferPiero della Francesca!As I understood Alexander's words,he meantthat it is peculiar for a manto change, of his own free will,into a work of art.Generally,the result of all poetic strivinglies so far from its authorthat one can hardly believethat it is a man-made creation.In the case of the actor, though,the reverse is true.The actor is, himself, his owncreation, his own work of art.Excuse me.- I'll be right back.- Don't stay long!How much gas have we left?Will it last?I don't know. I'll see.They brought new cylinders last week.Don't you remember?Julia, come here to us.- Who is it?- It's me.Mr Alexander?Has something happened?But why stand there? Come in.It was only by chancethat I heard you knock.The kerosene ran out,so I got up to fill the lamp.Has something happened?Why don't you say anything?What is it? Is it something at home?Something's happenedat your house again.Is that it?But don't you...don't you have a TV?Yes, a small one. But...it went dead about 11:00,and didn't come on again.What...What's happened to your hands?I fell off the bike.Did you come on a bike?Yes, I did. I fell.Come.You mustn't go aboutwith dirty hands.Thank you.You're welcome.As a child, I played this pr?lude.My mother loved it.Years ago,before I was married,I often went to visit my mother...in the country.She was still alive in those days.Her house, a little cottage,was surrounded by a garden...a little garden,dreadfully neglected and overgrown.No one had tended it for many yearsand I don't think...anyone had ever been in it.Even then, my mother was very ill.She hardly ever left the house.Still,amidst the ruined gardenthere was something that was,in its way, beautiful.Yes, now I know what it was.When the weather was fine...she often sat at the window...looking out at the garden. She evenhad a special chair by the window.Once, though, I decidedthat I would tidy things up...in the garden, that is.I wanted to mow the grass,burn the weeds, prune the trees.On the whole,I wanted to redo the gardenin my own taste...with my own hands.Yes, simply to please my mother.And for two solid weeks...I went at itwith shears and a scythe.I dug...and cut...and sawed...and weeded.I kept my noseto the ground, literally.And I took great painsto get it ready as soon as possible.My mother's condition grew worse,and she kept to her bed.But I wanted her to be able...to sit by the windowand see...her new garden.In short,when I was finishedand everything was ready...I took a bath...put on fresh underwear,a new jacket, even a tie.Then I sat down in the chairto see what I'd made,through her eyes, as it were.I...I sat there...and looked out through the window.I had prepared myselfto enjoy the sight.Anyway, I looked out the windowand saw...What did I see?Where had all the beauty gone?All that was natural.It was so disgusting.All that evidence of violence!I remember once,when my sister was young.She went to a barber and had herhair cut. It was the fashion then.Her hair was unbelievably lovely.Golden yellow, like Lady Godiva's.She came home pleased as punch.Then my father saw her.He began to cry.I think it was the samewith the garden.And your mother?It's three o'clock!We won't have time...But your mother... did she see it?Maria...My being heremust be an imposition on you.You can't sleep.What do you mean?What do you mean?Could you...Could you love me, Maria?What are you saying?Love me, I beg you!Save me!Save us all!I know who you are.He... he told me!Please, please!Save us, I beg you!What are you talking about?Go home now.Do you want me to go with you?I... I have a bicycle, too.Don't kill us.Save us, Maria!But why?You poor, poor man!Why? No, not that way!You poor man.Don't be afraid. What's wrong?Calm down, calm down.I understand, I know...that it concerns your home.I know her, she is wicked.I know her. They've hurt you...frightened you.Don't be afraid of anything.Everything's going to be all right.Be calm.Don't be afraid, not of anything.It's all right now, all right.You poor, poor man!There, there.There's nothing to fear.Don't be afraid.Nothing will happen to you here.Don't cry, don't cry.Everything will be fine.- Just love me.- Yes.My poor dear.What have they done to you?- No.- There, there...No... no.What is it?- Calm down!- No, no!I c-c-can't!I can't!Drink this.No.There...It'll soon be over.What's frightened you so, Alexander?Mama!Hello.Hello, is that Martin?Yes. Alexander?Yes, it's me!Your voice is so weak.Oh! Better now?- Yes, it's better.- I wonder, is the editor in?Yes, but I don't think he's free.You can't imaginewhat things are like here today.You were to see him next week.Yes, but it wasn't important.A trifle... it doesn't matter.I'll call back.All right, until then.By the way, many happy returns!On what? Oh, of course!Mama, did you know thatour Victor is leaving for Australia?What did you say? To Australia?Yes, and he's not coming back.He's been offered his own clinic.I heard it last night.Right, Victor?- Why are you laughing?- I'm not laughing!When did you decide that?Australia!You must be mad!I don't know why I chose Australia.I don't know.It doesn't matter.I'm tired, that's all.All right!But what's to become of us?Of Alexander?The fact is, what I'm most tired ofis the lot of you.Tired of being your nursemaid.Your nursemaid and your warden.Tired of wiping your noses.- Victor, are you mad?- Forgive me.What are you saying?May I smoke?Martha, go away! Go, go, go!Go, go, go!God, Mama. I'm not a child!Call your father to breakfast!- But...- Is it too much to ask?All right, I'll go.Oh, her ways!So calculating!I won't let you go, Victor!I don't know about Mama,but I won't let you go!Something's wrong hereand I'm fed up with it.Yes. You can forget about me,and Martha, and the boy...But Alexander is your friend!He always will be.But he needs you!He has a wife to take care of him.She ought to, anyway.He has a family, a splendid house...- and a son he adores.- Fine and dandy!Julia!Fetch your mistress's jacket!She's cold!How thoughtful!Little Man! Where is he?Look, he's left this note.What does it say?""My dears, I've slept badlythis night. Please don't wake me.Go and take a little walk.The boy will show you his 'Japanesetree' that we planted yesterday.Or was it today?I don't remember, it matters not.I kiss you all.I've taken my pills.Forgive me, even now.June 19, 1985.10:07. Papa A.""Shall we take a walkbefore the weather changes?""Forgive me, even now""...What did he mean by that?And why the exact time?Mama, you know how he is.""How he is...""I think his kindnesswould be enoughto see us all through.But he'll be around longer than that.""How he is...""!What did I say wrong?Have you enough kindness for ""him""?All right, Victor.But why must he be such a child?Maybe I want to be a child as well!We all want something.I, for one, want to go to Australia.Well, gather the ashes.Put them in a glass,fill it with wine, and drink it.- Why?- Don't ask me.Someone said so.If you do, you'll remember thisfor the rest of your life.Come, let's go.Julia, come with us!Fetch the boy and we'll go.I had a dream recently.I was walking the streets, begging.When I woke, I cried and cried.The boy's not there.He's already gone out.I think I know where.To the Japanese tree?He and the boy are just crazyabout Japan.Why Japan?First it's Australia, then Japan.God, I can't take much more of this!What about this morning?I turned on his music...But he didn't fancyanything Japanese. He turned it off.He says he and the boywere Japanese in an earlier life.I wish someone would tell himwhat to make of this life.Maybe that springsfrom a deep inner need.Maybe it's easier for him that way.Why can't I find an easier way?Can't you?You seem to haveall sorts of schemes to that end.But nothing quite so far-fetchedas Australia.My God,what is all that nonsense about?Australia! It's absurd!Flowers!I don't understand.What have I done with them?Where are they?Alexander!What's happened?I did it. Don't be upset!Listen to me, Victor.I've got something very impor...No! Silence!Say nothing! Ask nothing!Come, Alexander!You can't stay here!Come, now.Let him be!What are you doing to him?Don't touch him!See you, Alexander!""In the beginning was the Word.""Why is that, Papa?This film is dedicatedto my son Andrioshawith hope and confidenceAndrei Tarkovsky"

Tell me, please.Well, all right.Let's see...I guess it would have to start with... scissors!Scissors?Well, there are all kinds of scissors.And once there was even a manwho had scissors for hands.

Do you want something to eat?Are you hungry?Do you want a cracker?- He's different.- Completely different.No kidding.- He's so...- Mysterious.Yeah.D'you imagine those hands are hot or cold?And just think what a single snip could do.Or undo.Eddie. Eddie.The guys and I want to invite youto our card game Friday night.Would you like that?Only thing is... you can't cut!I have my own infirmity.Never did me a bit of harm.Took some shrapnel during the war,and ever since then I can't feel a thing!Don't you ever let anybody tell youyou have a handicap.Who's handicapped? My goodness.Don't be ridiculous!You're not handicapped, you're...What do they call the... exceptional?My name's Joyce, and I noticed that youhave not tasted any of the ambrosia salad......that I made especially for you.Allow me.Mmm!Mmmm!- You must try this. It's my mother's recipe.- Doesn't this look gorgeous?With a green thumb like yours,I sure could use your help at my place.I want a row of angels!I am so sorry, ladies, but he's promised tocome to my house first. Haven't you, Eddie?- I did?- OK, everybody, grab your plates!Soup's on!Azhuzhizha zhigabab.- What?- I thuzhizha zhizhgabab.It is shish kebab. It was a figure of speech.You shouldn't take things so literally.""Let us pretend we are in the drawingroom and the hostess is serving tea.""""Many numerous little questionsconfront us.""""Should the man risewhen he accepts his cup of tea?""""May lump sugar be taken with the fingers?""No.""Is it good form to accept a second cup?""""Should the napkin be entirely unfolded......or should the centre creasebe allowed to remain?""""It is so easy to commitembarrassing blunders......but etiquette tells usjust what is expected of us......and guards us from allhumiliation and discomfort.""Mm, yes. Boring.Let us switch to, uh......to some poetry, hm?""There was an old man from the Cape,""""Who made himself garments of crepe.""""When asked: Will they tear?""""He replied: Here and there,""""But they keep such a beautiful shape!""That's right.Go ahead, smile. It's funny.That's right.We're home.Shit.Everything's still sopping.- I can hardly wait to take a shower.- And to sleep in a bed.If my parents have the alarm set,I'm screwed.I told you to call themand tell them we're coming back early.- But did you?- Nope, he'd rather complain.How else am I supposed to get attention?- You didn't call your parents.- They don't run things like a police state.- Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny.- Bye.- Bye.- Bye.- Don't forget your arm!- Oh, yeah.Come on, Jim, let's go.There's somebody in my room!Go look! Look!He's a murderer!

I just wanted you twoto have a proper introduction.Edward, this is our daughter Kim.Kim, this is Edward,who's gonna live with us.Hi.H-h-h... H-h-h...Eddie!Thirsty?Kisses! Hush up!Shh, quiet now!Darlin', I can hardly hear myself think!Momma's precious little baby girl...Aah! Wouldn't you likea nice cool glass of lemonade?Lemonade?One chop to a guy's neck, and it's all over.Sharpest things in the world.They can hack through anything.And...They give me the creeps.You should see the clownin Miss Peters' yard.Kim!- Oh, no.- That's him?- He's calling you, Kimba.- Stop it!Edward, you forgot your cookies.Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for ya!- Stop!- Let's go.Bill, Edward had lunch at Jackie's today......and she just hadher kitchen completely redone.- I'll be darned.- New paint, new cabinets, new floors......a new microwave, new silent dishwasher...- Isn't that wonderful?Jim, didn't you just tell meyour mom had her kitchen done too?Yeah, my dad bought himselfa bunch of new toys.Big-screen TV, CD players,VCR with four heads...My goodness sake!I wonder what it's like to be that rich.They keep things locked up.My father has his own room for his stuffto make sure I can't use it.He won't even help me buy an old car.He probably wants you to pay for it yourself.It builds character. You'll appreciate it more.Dad!Speaking of money... I understand you'renot charging for your gardening, Edward.Now, Bill... Marge made him cookies today.Sweetheart...You can't buythe necessities of life with cookies.You can't buy a car with cookies.Am I right, Jim?Uh, that's true, sir, you can't.I... I can't eat that. He used his hands.It's... I don't think it's sanitary.I'm sorry.Honey, you want meto help you clean that up?No, that's OK.I'll be right back.Alexis? Oh, this can't possibly be my Alexis!She looks so beautiful! Look at you! Sweetie!She's gorgeous. Thank you!It won't be long.She just has to decide on the style.And then it'll be fine.I was hopin' for somethin' bigand kinda bouffant. Kinda like mine?Now don't you worry, Kisses, you're gonnabe just fine. You're gonna be so pretty.Yes, you are. Oh!Oh! My!Oh! Ohh!Oh! Eddie, is there anything you can't do?You take my very breath away, I swear.Look at this!Have you ever cut a woman's hair?Would you cut mine?That was the single most thrillin' experienceof my whole life.They're getting the head of the company!- I'm home!- Hi, honey. We're in here.- Hi.- Hi!What did you do to your hair?Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?Hello? Oh, I can't believeI'm talking to you in person.This is such an honour.Yes. He's right here.So then you know all about it.Uh-huh. Well, that's exactlywhat I've been using.Well, I've had a little trouble getting itthe right consistency... well, just a little.I'll try that. Uh-huh.Well, what imaginative suggestions.I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.No wonder she's the head of the company.You know, she started out asa sales representative just like me.I've always wanted to talk to her,but until now I never had a reason.Thanks, Edward.- She had some ideas?- You bet she did.- Uh-huh!- Mm-hm!I'll get that.Edward. We're here.Come on, let's get you sharpened up.- You got it?- No. I can't believe this.This is such a drag.Hi!- Bye.- Bye.Do you have a key?No.- I could have sworn they were in my purse.- Well, we're stranded.Wow! Thanks!Ed! What a guy! Good job.You didn't break it or scratch it or anything.Hey, be a pal and yellwhen Peg pulls in, huh?Quite a story, yes?Any questions for Edward?Yeah? Get away over.Stand right up.What's been the best partof your new life here in town?The friends I've made.Any other questions?Have you ever thought of havingcorrective surgery or prosthetics?I know a doctorthat might be able to help you.I'd like to meet him.We'll get that name after the show.Thank you. That's very nice.Anyone else? Yes, stand right up.But then you'd be like everyone else.Yes, I know.I think he'd like that.But then no one wouldthink you were special.You wouldn't be on TV or anything.No matter what,Edward will always be special.More questions? Yes. Stand right up.Your work is so interesting,distinctive and unique.Do you have any plansto open your own beauty salon?Oh, there's an idea!Anyone else? Yeah. Stand right up.- Do you have a girlfriend?- Ohhhh!Sure he does. Right, Kim?- Right, Kim?- Great! Now you got him started.Knock it off, bubble-butt.- You did it.- So?How about it, Edward?Is there some special lady in your life?Ooh...Uh... everything's all right. We'll take a breakand we'll be back after these messages.Why are you laughing? He got hurt!- It was just a little shock. What do you care?- A little shock?!I wish we'd been taping that.I'd give my left nut to see that again.Aren't you excited? This is so thrillin'!Wait till I show it to you. It's just perfect.It's just what we've been lookin' for.I wanna call it Shear Heaven!Ohh! And here we are.Now, all along hereI'm gonna put a row of new mirrors.And back along here, well, I think...Eddie! Come along, doll.Back up here a whole row of new cosmetics.And all along this row here...- Peg could sell cosmetics.- Yeah... Sure.And this of courseis where we wash the hair.And here is where I stand...when I greet the customers.But back in hereis what I really wanna show you.Eddie... This is whatI really want to show you.Now, this is the storeroomwhere we keep everything......and what I need from you todayis a decision I need you to help me make.Oh, honey, no! No, don't. That's dangerous.Now, you just sit right down there...I have some smocks.Would you like me to model them for you?Yes.OK.* With these hands* I will cling to you* I'm yours for ever* And a dayNow, this is my favourite.Because it's yellow...And what it's for......is to catch those itchy littletrimmings that fall down your neck.And then there's this old purple onethat you just kinda......drape around you like this.I like that one.Why, Eddie, you're tremblin'.So am I!I've been waitin' for this moment for so long.* And with these hands* I'll provide for you* Should there be a stormy sea* I'll turn the tide for you* And I'll never* Oh no, I'll never* I'll never let you goAagghh!Edward!Edward, you come back here!You can't do that!Velcro, sweetheart.- It hangs on the dashboard.- I've never seen that.- Sorry I'm late.- Hi, Edward.Sorry, dear, we had to go ahead without you.There you go.So, Edward, did you have a productive day?Mrs Monroe showed mewhere the salon will be.- You could have a cosmetics counter.- Wouldn't that be great?Great.Then she showed me the back roomwhere she took all her clothes off.Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.I'm as pleased as punch.This venture's gonna teach you volumes.There's nothin' likerunning your own business.I've never done it myself......but I gather it's the greatest satisfactiona working man can have.So I guess the bank'sgonna be your next step, huh?The bank?Yeah. Take out a loan, get yourself started.Nothin' to worry about. With your talentand reputation, it's gonna be a snap.Yeah.No credit......no record ofjobs you've held......no savings......no personal investments...No social security number -you may as well not even exist...- There is no collateral.- No, we already have a second on the house.But don't the testimonials count?Did you see here the mayor's wifecan't wait to become a client?We simply can't do it.Now, get yourself a social security card,establish credit and buy yourself a car.You have a decided advantage.You can get a handicapped placard......and park anywhere you like.I can't believe it. It's just an outrage.But don't you worry. This isn't the end of it.We'll get your money somehow.- But that's breaking and entering.- My parents have insurance up the rear.What'll it cost them?A little hassle, that's about it.- We can't.- This guy'll give us cash for the stuff.I don't want to.You don't want us to have our own van wherewe can be alone? And a mattress in the back?Why can't you do it?Because the room's lockedand we need Edward to get us in.Can't you take the key when he's sleeping?The only thing he hangs on to tighteris his dick.- Razor Blades'll do anything for you.- That's not true.- Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?- That's not fair.- So what? There isn't any other way.- There's gotta be.Look, I've racked my brain.Don't you want us to have our own van?Well... yeah.Jim, the lights are on!Those go on automatically.They're gone for the weekend, I told you.In case of burglars.- You turned off the alarm?- Yes. Let's go.I hate this.Are you sure he doesn't knowthis is Jim's house?- This person stole from you?- Shh! Keep it down!I told you he stole it, OK? Let's go!Tell his parentsand they'll make him give it back.Listen, I already tried that.Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Let's go.Come on!Come on!OK, come on. Come on.Come on, come on, come on! Now! Come on!The bastard had it wired separately.Come on!No, Jim, we can'tjust leave him here!- Come on.- I'm not gonna do this!- Just come on, Kim.- Stop!Put me down!Put me down!We know you're in there!We're in the process of deactivatingthe system so that you can come out!- Denny, turn around!- No way.Jim, they can't arrest youfor setting off your own alarm.We'll tell 'em we freaked and ran.- I'm not going back there, OK?- We have to!No. My father would prosecute.- His own son?- Especially his own son.And if Edward tells I'll kill him!- Denny, turn around!- No!You have to!We want your hands high in the airwhere we can see them!Put your hands up!He's holding something. Looks like knives.Drop your weapons!I repeat- drop your weapons!I'm gonna ask you one more time.This is your last warning. Drop your weapons.If you fail to do so we'll have to open fire.Don't make us do that, buddy.Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!Now!Looks like we got a psycho.- Prepare to fire!- No! No!- Stand back, ladies!- Those aren't weapons, those are his hands!Please. We know him.All right. Cuff him.- But we can see him now?- We're going to have to hold him overnight.- He has to stay in prison all night?- You can pick him up in the morning.Oh, Edward!Hello, Edward.Oh, Edward, dear. I blame myself.What in God's namewas going through your mind, son?Why didn't I set a better example?You saw how I envied Jim's parents.What were you gonna do with that stuff?I blithely say ""We'll get moneyfor the salon somehow""......but I never meant stealing.Dear, stealing's not the way to get it.Stealing's not the way to get anything.Uh-uh. Except trouble.And you're in a serious heap of that.Oh, Edward. Why ever did you do this?- Damn those TV programmes!- Damn them all to hell!Or did somebody put you up to this?Will he be OK, doc?The years spent in isolation have not givenhim the tools to judge right from wrong.He's had no context.He's been completely without guidance.Furthermore his work, the garden sculptures,hairstyles and so forth......indicate that he's a highly imaginative......character.His awareness of what we call realityis radically underdeveloped.But will he be all right out there?Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.Listen, it could keep me up all night worryingabout ya. You watch yourself, you hear?I happened to be up,so I heard all this noise...All along I felt in my gutthere was somethin' wrong with him.- It could have been my house.- Or any of our houses, but...I warned you, didn't I?I saw the sign of Satan on him.You didn't heed my warning, but nowyou will. Because now you can see it too.Edward, you stay here.- What do you say in your defence?- Nothing.- He doesn't want to talk.- You have to say something.- He can't talk right now.- No comments? No remarks?So, were you set up?What was going through your mind?Huh? What do you have to say for yourself?- One comment. One comment.- Later.Goodness, Lois, it looks likeI'll see you at our Christmas party......before I get you over for your haircut!Well, of course we're gonna have it this year.We have it every year. Why wouldn't we?Well!You may think that, but you're wrong.You're here.They didn't hurt you, did they?Were you scared?I tried to make Jim go back,but you can't make Jim do anything.Thank you for not telling them that we...You're welcome.It must have been awfulwhen they told you whose house it was.I knew it was Jim's house.You... you did?Yes.Well, then why'd you do it?Because you asked me to.Kimba!Kimmy! Hey!- Don't!- What's the matter with you?When are you gonna stop? I did what I could.My old man thinks he's retarded, so he's free.What more do you want?- You could tell the truth.- So could you. You were there too!- You know I didn't wanna do it.- But you did do it.I don't get why you give such a shit anyway.Maybe there's a way you canreplace the drapes and the towels......but our confidence in youis not gonna be so easy to replace.Dad...OK. A little ethics. You're walkin' downthe street. You find a suitcase full of money.There's nobody around. No human personis in evidence. What do you do?A: You keep the money.B: You use it to buy giftsfor your friends and your loved ones.C: You give it to the poor.D: You turn it in to the police.- Dad, this is really stupid.- Kim!- I'd keep the money.- Simmer down.Edward?Hey, how about after dinner we go downto the bowling alley? That'd be fun.You're not seeing Jim tonight?No.We had the coolest show and tell today.This kid brought in a box of baby possums.Ten, maybe twelve. Totally naked.- No hair at all.- Honey, your father isn't finished yet.Thank you, dear. Edward, we're waiting.Give it to my loved ones?Oh, Edward, it does seem thatthat's what you should do, but it's not.You dope, everybody knowsyou're supposed to give it to the police.Good thinking, Kevin.Well, think about it, you guys.I mean, that's the nicer thing to do.That's what I would do.We're not trying to confuse him, we're tryingto make things easier, so cut the comedy.I am being serious, Dad.It's a much nicer thing to do.Forget nice. We're talking right and wrong.Shut up!Oh, goodness! No wonder poor Edward can'tlearn right from wrong, living in this family!Well, did you hearwhat he did to Peg's curtains?It's unbelievable they're havingtheir party anyway. Are you going?I don't think so.He practically raped Joyce,threatening her with those knives.It's a miracle she escaped.I have nothing against Bill and Peg, but...I know.

I am Father Ivan, your teacher.He's the pedagogical priest.I am going to showyou the Seminar.Only for your children.The morning prayeris daily at 6:30 am.Next is the first hour of study.Followed by breakfast,with classes until 2pm,lunch, and rest until 4pm.- We can go out?- Only with written authorization.And call home?Only with the permissionof the pedagogical priest.Otherwise,they get 5 days of suspension.He was gone for onenight, it means expulsion.Are you already fighting over food?What is it?This is our chapel.It may seem simple,but it is a sacred place.See it as the 1st churchwhere you will serve.The lab,in which to learnpriestly rites.Priest,is it mandatory toattend all prayers?Should a future priest ask that?10 absence from prayersmeans 5 days of suspension.If you are suspended 2times you are expelled.The pedagogical priestwill do the counting.Your future will dependon his record book.It will reflect yourmoral principles.You are here to become priests.""You are not yourselves"".1 Corinthians 6:19.A clean heart and record,they have nothing to fear.The pedagogical priestis rather rigid,but do not be afraid,I will be your pastor.I want us to be themost united class.- Do you want that too? - We do!It looks like my watch.I think he stole my wallet!Look at that brown skin.Hide your valuables!I will keep mythings under the bed.Stop it now.What's yours, four-eyes?- Leave him alone! - Fades away.What is the problem?They're calling him a gypsy.And what if he is a gypsy?I'm not even a gypsy.- I'm Arab. - Is what?I'm Arab. Born in Israel.So, what are you doing here?- What are you doing here?- I'm an Orthodox Romanian.I have a right to be here.My mother is Romanian,my grandfather is a priest.I have every right to be here.I know all about Arabs.They flee their country,to escape military service,make our womenpregnant and run back.- Don't talk like that.- It's true.I visit my fatherabroad every summer.- As if given a visa.- I don't need one.I have this.I can leave thecountry at any time.Let me see.- And then?- That's right, Father.Aid... Akili.- Akil. - Akil.- Lights out in 5 minutes.- What about prayer?You will pray here tonight.I can read?Tudor is going to read tonight.Let's read the shortest passage.No, if it is to be done,let us do it the right way.In the name of the Father,the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.Eternal god,King of every creature,forgive the sinsI committed today.Purify my soul of all impurity.Most Holy Trinity,because of the abundanceof your goodnessyou were not bored with me,you have not ruined mein my transgressions;but in your compassionyou lifted me up,being in despairso that at dawn I may singthe glory of your majesty.Light up your eyesof my understanding...Mogli! You were missed, idiot.In the name of the Father, the Sonand the Holy Spirit.- Now and...- Go a little further.Have mercy on me, God,erase my transgression,cleanse me from my sin.Ask questions,search for answers!Discuss with each other,or with the teachers.Do not be afraid to becurious, we are here to learn.You can ask me anything.Come on,show that you are brave!Yes, you can talk.You don't have to get up.Why do you say,""Believe it and don't question it""?Good question!This is pseudo-Christian.The Bible never says that,it's the people who say it.The simplest and mostlogical explanation would be:imagine the truthbeing the top of a mountain.The path of faith takesus straight there.The path of science takesa spiral route.Because scienceneeds proof.Both will arrive there,but we can wait for millennia.As humans, wasting precious timetrying to prove what faithhas already confirmed.More questions?Excuse me, how many prayersshould we say a day?Morning and night,before and after each meal,plus those beforeand after class.A total of 10 prayers.Senior students are notgoing to let us bathe.Try tomorrow.We tried all week!Who is swearing? Hold this.Excuse.Get in line!Gabi,don't let your glasses fog up.- Get out of the way!- What's your problem?As I said?Enough is enough.What is it, you son of a bitch?You are lacking in respect.Wait.Stop it.I'm going to kill him.What's going on?How could you hit him?He called me a son of a bitch.What about?He will lose points,you can be expelled.Why do you think hedidn't fight back?Boys...Violence has noplace in our church.Talk to me, don't hit people.Father, if they expelme, it's not your fault.But it is.That's why I'm here.To fight for you,to protect you.Give it to me when oneof you is in danger.You were chosen from manyfor that sacred mission.Expulsion is likean ecumenical death.It is like betraying yourmission, disappointing God,who chose them.And risk it for bullshit?The rest can go. Killed...Pedagogical Father,take everyone, pray to Godsave us from the Council.Gabriel, why did it take?I went to get my technique.Sit down.Did you see him slapping?But he cursed him.- So you were there. - Was.Lastly, we can prove thatthere was a provocation.Write down what you saw.The rest also wrotetheir testimonies.It's a shame, he's a good guy.I know.So if I do that,will he be okay?Of course!My God.What about, faithful flock?Who told you?Was you?Was this the bedof the ""deceased""?- Was you? - Hold it for me.Drop that Bible! Now!We can attack each other,but don't tell us off.They didn't expel himbecause of the slap.But why did someonewrite a statement.Who?- We tell what we saw.- Talking doesn't make you expelled.Someone wrote.- It was all written.- Nobody wrote anything.Assurance?What if your friendhere wrote it?Take it easy.No, I was there!Are you saying we're wrong?Forget it, they are very dumb.- Was you?- Are you a foreigner?You look foreign. No?Sorry, I think it is.Come on, Olah!We're fine, man.Don't worry. We will find a way.- God bless you. - Amen.Priest!You said he wouldnot be expelled.Of course he was expelled.But they provoked him!What difference does?You said that othersalso wrote statements.One was enough.You made me believe,that I was helping him.Are you asking me tobe accountable, boy?Mail arrived. Tudor!- Where is he? - In the chapel.- Lupu? - It's me.- Aid Akil. - On here.- Everything.- It's in the dining room.Father, why is my letter open?She arrived like this.It's from daddy in Israel!And now?If you open that door,you will be missed.Come with me.We will explain why we are late.Okay.Gabi!Enter.Why are you here?He's with me.I'll be missed. My first.Can you believe this guy?Please,we're just a minute late.Pedagogical priest.Pedagogical priest, please.Don't give us a miss.Was anyone else late?Father, wait!For a minute?Pedagogical priest, please.It was just a minute.And now?Now?You will have a clean record.What about you?Holy, Holy, Holy,it is the Lord, God.Have mercy on us...out of bed and sleep,you lifted me upenlighten me so thatI can worship Him.- Holy, holy... - Hurry up.Start with the psalms.Psalm 50.

Where's the exit?How did you get in here?I fell in, same as you.You look like you've beenwalking around for a long time.Shut up!I won't take pity from a thief.Well, we may as well relax.There's no way out of here.'Scuse me, pal.Hey, Old Man, you got a light?Lupin, what's with all these bodies?I doubt this is a graveyard.Take a look at that wall.Th-This is-Rest in peace.I thought there was somethingsuspicious about this castle...but what sort of secret is worththis much trouble to hide?Hey, Lupin.Is that what you're after here?That's what Fujiko's after.I hope she doesn't end uplike these bodies in here.Anyway, running aroundin a panic won't help us.Good night, Old Man.It's cold!Man, look how long it's been.How do things look?Still no movement.Then I guess we just wait.They're taking too long.Mr. Jodo!They've found it!Heave-ho!Curse you, Lupin!These are coffins.What is all this?These are Japanese 10,000 yen bills.Looks like this all is.These are really well-made.Hey, Old Man, look!West German 1,000 mark bills.Pounds. Dollars.Francs. Rubles. Rupees.Pesos. Crowns. Lira.They've even got won!It's the whole world in here.They're making counterfeits.Lupin, is this the castle's secret?Exactly. This is thesource of the counterfeits...that were supposedly betterthan the originals: The Goat bills.The counterfeit moneywhich inevitably moved...in the shadow of the upheavalsof medieval Europe.It caused the collapseof the Bourbon dynasty...became Napoleon'ssource of funding...and eventually triggeredthe world bank panic of 1927.Appearingon the backstage ofhistory...as the star of the black hole:The Goat bills.Of all the people who came herelooking for their source...not a single one of themever returned.I've heard rumors about this...but who'd ever believe anindependent nation was running it?What're you gonna do,Old Man?After seeing this,there's no going back.I know!It makes my cop's blood burn.How about a truceuntil we get out of here?Very well, but I won'thelp you steal anything.And after we're out of here,I swear I'll arrest you.It's settled, then.Let's shake on it.- I won't be corrupted.- Corrupted?- Miss Fujiko.- The time's come to say good bye.Who are you?To all appearances,I'm the one woman...who is employed herein the castle as your servant.But in reality, I'm a lady spy who'slooking for this castle's secret.I was hoping to stay a little longer,but now Lupin's come.Everything's fallen apart,so I'm leaving.You know that man?Only too well.Sometimes we're allies,at others we're enemies.Occasionally, we're even lovers.The guy's a natural born lady-killer.Watch your step around him.He walked out on you?Oh, hardly.I walked out on him.There's smoke comingfrom the trapdoor.A fire?It's coming from underground.- Movement.- He's started.Fire! Fire!Trouble! A fire's started inthe underground printing plant.- What?

Don't do it.Under his collar.Lupin always hides things there.Darn it, Fujiko!I have the ring.Let this man and Fujiko go,or I'll throw it into the lake.You have my word.Now put the ring on and come here.- Shall I shoot?- Wait until we have the ring.Lupin!Shoot!Don't let them escape!Liar!You said you'd let them go.Let them go after they've seenthe underground plant?At last, it's mine.Lupin, you owe me for today.See you.We didn't even get to join in,and we're already pulling out!Oh, it's no use.Jump for it!Once again,I cut a worthless object.Lupin! Don't you dare diebefore I get to arrest you!Whatever we do,it'll mean trouble.It's some sort of plot.Give the order for us to go in!Look how clear all this evidence is.I saw it myself.The latest printing equipment,all over the room like-We understand that!This is a high-levelpolitical problem...and Interpol's jurisdiction islimited to international crime.Chief, the crime is clear!You don't understand.The one committing it is an independentmember of the United Nations.Even Interpol can't conducta forcible criminal investigation.Besides that,the situation isn't in our favor at all.Have you seen the pictures on thefront pages of the world's newspapers?""Count bravely defends his bride!Lupin's attempt to kidnapPrincess Clarisse fails!""Along with reports of a henchmandisguised as Zenigata.That was really me!Wasn't that a bit rashfor an officer in your position?The truth has to be told!The problem is whetherworld opinion will believe you.There's no way we can win.The Count has many friends amongthe Western governments, does he not?The truth may cause troublefor a lot of nations.Yes, considering the evidencethat these mass-produced...counterfeit dollars wereordered by a certain country!And these counterfeit rublesweren't ordered by the CIA?Gentlemen, please!You will not bring your countries'quarrels into these chambers!The only way to deal with this...is for each country tocome up with its own solution!Inspector,we're ready to move out.We can leave for Cagliostroat any time.We won't be moving out.As soon as they choose my replacement,we'll be off the Lupin case.All of you,get ready to go home.It's me.- Food.- Thanks.- How is he?- His fever seems to have dropped.Thanks to the treatmentyou gave him.If you want to thank anyone,thank the dog.That old dog doesn't like anyone,but he won't leave that man's side.If not for that,I never would have hidden you here.Hello, Karl.He's awake.Lupin, how do you feel?Jigen. Goemon.It's been a while.A while?What's he talking about?I think his wounds havetemporarily confused his memory.Karl, why aren't youwith your owner today?How do you knowthat dog's name?The only other person besides mewho knows it's Karl is Princess Clarisse.Clarisse?So your owner's name is Clarisse.Clarisse...Lupin?Jigen! How many days?How many days has it been?Uh, three.What? That meansthe wedding's tomorrow.I have to-Don't push yourself.You'll reopen your wounds.Food. Bring me food.Food?Some porridge, maybe?I've lost a lot of blood.Anything'll do. Bring me a feast.Well, that's easyfor you to say, but-I'll see what I can do.You damn fool!Don't eat so fast.Your body can't take that much.Shut up! Gimme 12 hoursand I'll be as fit as a jet plane!See? I told you so.Need a wash basin?What?He says now he'll sleep.I see.He did it for Princess Clarisse.But now thatLupin's hurt this badly-You seem to be connected withMiss Clarisse from the past, old man.I tended the palace gardens.Princess Clarisseloved plants as a child.When her family died andshe was sent off to the convent...she gave me this dog.He must have smelled theprincess's scent on Lupin's body.But, then, how could he haveknown the dog's name?I dunno. Lupin can be charmedby women really easily, but-- It wasn't like that.- What, you're awake?It happened 10 years ago.I was a young hotshot kidwho was just starting out on his own.I acted like an idiot.To top it all off,I decided to go after the Goat bills.Somehow, I made it to the shore,but I could move no further.Karl? What's wrong, Karl?I thought my numberhad finally come up.Water.As her trembling handsgave me the water...I noticed a ring on her finger,sparkling in the light.I'm ashamed to say this...but until I saw the ring again,I'd forgotten completely about it.That was Fujiko's bike.It's a clipping from today's paper.""An archbishop is coming fromthe Vatican tomorrow morning...to perform the wedding.""I'm off the case!Fujiko?What? Lupin's gonna hitthe wedding? Really?If you're after Lupin, your superiorswon't mind your going in there, right?That's right!That's how we'll play it.We're in a hurry. Move!Forget it.Everything past here is all jammed up.There was a landslideseven kilometers up the road.Isn't there some other road?We're going to be late.Would you by any chancebe the archbishop?Ah, yes, you are.Would you please bless this lamb?Say, you're a local, right?There any other roads to Cagliostro?If you don't mind a country road,there's one that way.We're saved!Can you show us the way?C'mon, hop in.Yes.Anything for the archbishop.C'mon, push! One more hilland we're in Cagliostro.We've gotta get thereby nightfall.Is it really such a good ideato have TV cameras in here?His Excellency wishesto show the world...that this is a properand legal marriage.The archbishop has arrived.Do you supposeLupin will come?My Shadows are guarding the bride.All you need worry aboutis guarding the front gate.The time has comefor light and shadow to be united.Come, Clarisse.Bring forward the proof...that these are truly noble membersof the ancient bloodline of Cagliostro.In accordance to the old custom...you shall exchange ringsand recite your vows.Clarisse d' Cagliostro, daughterof the Grand Duke of Cagliostro...do you have no objectionto this marriage?Silence will be taken as agreement.God's blessing upon you.I object!This wedding is soiledby the Count's desires.- A curse!- Don't panic.The meddlers have simplymade their appearance.In the name of the deadwho lie beneath this castle...I have come to take your bride.- We can't have the wedding now.- Step back.This will make fine entertainment.Clarisse, I've come for you.Ghosts!This is terrible, ladies and gentlemen.It's Lupin! Lupin has appeared.Stop the broadcast.- What are you doing?- Move out!Clarisse! Clarisse!Poor girl.They've drugged you, haven't they?The damned Count.He didn't want you able to speak.- Mr. Thief!- No, dear. Stay back.You were a fool, Lupin.Finish the others!Clarisse.Don't cry, Clarisse.I'm coming for you now.Money?Do you like my present, Count?Excellency!They're the counterfeit bills you made.Take it as payment for the rings.Damn him!

Charge!Zenigata's men are openinga path to the altar.And here come the royal guardswith Captain Gustav in the lead.Rear guard, deploy!Stand your ground!Justice is on our side.This is a really fierce fight, folks!What could be under the altar?It's a stairway!There's a hole leading underground.Could Lupin be in that hole?Let's take a camera in and find out.Curse you, Lupin!- Lupin!- What's that idiot doing?He's disobeying orders.Recall him!This is a satellite broadcast.It's too late.What can this be?Why, it looks justlike the National Mint!And what do I see over there?Good grief! Japanese money!It must be counterfeit.- Lord, what a bad actor.- What a terrible discovery!Look.

It is so great to meet you.I'm mon El, one of the other traineesat legion academy.Mon El?Wait, you're Kryptonian?Daxamite, actually, from planet daxam.But I hope you don't mindme saying this.I love Krypton.That's why I changed my name.I've been a fan ever since I was a kid.The scientific wonders,the emphasis on conformity, order.The robots.The robots.Maybe not so much the kryptonite,but in every other way,Krypton was incredible.I know we've just met,but I really hope you decideto come trainwith us here at the academy.- Really?- Yep.- It seemed like you weren't sure.- I am now.We could still go back and trainon the farm together.Nope. I'm good.Lift tractors?Bye, kal. Sorry, you can't stay.Want the tour?This is the legion academy.It's where our training takes place.The cube is the fight simulation room.It's also connected to the legion'sholographic library...I'm sure you'll be able to findyour way around.And that's pretty much the tour.Except the dorms...Girls are there, boys are there.And the window we use to sneak outafter curfew is there.Noted.What's that one?That's the vault.It's where the legion keepsall the weaponsthey've taken from their enemies.It's protected by an insanesecurity system,and it's never been broken intoin the entire history of the legion.The system's on a hair trigger,and it's completely off-limitsto us academy members.So, in other words,avoid the death lasers.- This is dawnstar.- Your roommate.Oh!I am so glad to meetsomeone else who can fly.We can pair up in trainingand practice cool power combos.Ooh, and team up for missions.Sorry. I'm all, ""blah, hi, dawnstar.""It's just nice to meet a new friend.Well, that's everything,except meeting the restof the academy trainees and...Brainiac?He's got a weapon. Get back!Wait!I don't knowhow you survived the bullet,but I am not goingto let you hurt anyone else.I don't know what you're talking about.But given your unhinged actions,I'm regarding you as a threat.Unhinged?You tried to kill Superman, my cousin.Believe me,if I had tried to kill Superman,I would have succeeded.I am the universe'sonly 12th-level intellect.I invented this force field usingkinetic-reactive photonic energy.Which means, the moreyou punch it, the more solid it gets.Great. Thanks for the tip.Okay. That's it.Fight, fight...Fight, fight, fight,fight, fight, fight, fight,fight, fight, fight, fight.Stop!What the ever-loving hellis going on here?Reckless endangermentand damage to a classroom.What do you have to say for yourselves?He's brainiac.Why are we all just sitting here?As I attempted to tell you,I am not brainiac.You pulled a weapon on us.I was going to make repairs on the laserfor a projectand you jump to conclusions.Not surprising for a lesser mind.How is this not a villain?Kara, he's not brainiac.This is brainiac 5.Scientists on planet colugot their hands on the organic partsof the original brainiac cyborgand then used that to makehim and his family.That is a gross oversimplificationof the cloning process.- Anyhow...- Rna mutation alone has allowed meto surpass my clone siblings.Anyhow...He's a bright young man,and he's enrolled in legion academy,just like you.By ""bright young man,""she means I possessa 12th-level intelligenceas measured by the scientificminds of col...Since we don't have time to sufficientlydescribe me,that will have to do.I've gotsome words to describe you.Unless those words are ""genius,""they're probably incorrect.Hey, knuckleheads, you're in trouble.The rest of the legionare off on a mission,leaving the three of us in charge,and you just made our jobsthat much more difficult.We are truly disappointed.Since this is your first offense,we're letting you off with a warning.But in the future, try to act more likethe heroes you wish to become.Dismissed.What is president saturn girl thinking,letting that kid in?Superman vouched for Supergirl.I'm talking about brainiac 5.Why is he here?Every single brainiac cloneever has gone evil.Brainiac 2was an intergalactic assassin.Brainiac 3 tried to overthrowthe united planets with mind control.Brainiac 4is just a straight up serial killer.This is what they do.The brainiacs show up,attempt some evil plot, then disappear.It's only a matter of timebefore this kid does the same.Look, timber wolf, we agree with you,but we were outvoted.Were we?I haven't spoken to a single otherlegionnaire who voted to let him in.I think there'ssomething fishy going on here.We've got bigger problemsthan your conspiracy theories right now.We still have no ideawhere the rest of the legion is.Last check-in, saturn girland the others were on their wayto deal with the terrorist attackson planet durla.Then, suddenly, boom, radio silence.Oh. They're still not answering comms?They're not even showing up on the map.It's like they disappeared from the faceof the universe.We've been having computer troublesover the past 24 hours.The issue could be on our end.We can't discountanything at this point.Shadow lass, chemical king,look into our system.It could just be bouncing boypulling prankswith the comm arrays again.But if not, we need to be prepared.And above all,don't tell the academy kids.The less who know, the better.It has to be tonight.That was epic!Did they kick you out?Uh, shewouldn't be here if they did.Everyone, give her room.Kara,this is the rest of the legion academy.Seriously, that fight was nuts.I'm bouncing boy, planet earth.Ta-da!Now, if I said to you,I've got a bunch of naltorian frogs,would you be down to help me releasethem in the science lab?No -come on. It'd be great.Enchanté.Invisible kid, also from planet earth.Whoa!Can you turn other thingsinvisible too?Yes.Well, actually, no,but I'm really close to figuring it out.Okay. I love the hair.Oh, yeah, hate the cape.We can work with the boots.Triplicate girl. Planet cargg.Okay, so, this is phantom girl.She's shy.Proty, our class pet.Hello.And arms fall off boy.And sometimes they even stay on.Wow.That's... really cool.No. We suck.Hey, that's not true.I'll have you know my psychicpathfinding powers are unique.Yes, so are mine.That doesn't mean they're good.There's only one open legion spot.And everyone knowsmon e! Is gonna get it.We're never going to makeit into the legion.Faceitwe're waiting-list material at best.Not even the legion of substitute heroeswould have us.Hey, you don't knowwhat's going to happen.I think everyonehas the potential to be heroes,even people like brainiac 5.But maybe, for the safetyof the rest of the buildings,you should just avoid him.The legiondoes more than simply fight.- We are the once called in...- Or maybe you can't.When there are disasters,diplomatic incidentsor when people are in need of rescue.To be considered for the legion,you need to train your mind.So, who can solvethis hyperdrive equation?Supergirl?Supergirl!That is clearly incorrect.The legion doesmore than simply solve problems.We are the front lines,stopping terrorists,administering justice,and preventing war.To be considered for the legion,you need to train your body.Training room, fight simulation beta.Acknowledged.Flight simulation betawill commence now.Got it!Oh, no.Too slow.No.You need a stabilizerso the a! System doesn't malfunction.No, you don't, because it's alreadyin the programming.I am literallythe descendant of a cyborg.Logically, you shouldbe listening to me.I'm from Krypton. We invented robotics.And I'm from colu, we perfected them.I'm right!You are objectively in the wrong.Okay. Maybe it did need a stabilizer.We need to shut it down.- If you damage the psionic processor...- Way ahead of you.Just give me some space to move.There.Engage the motion targeting system.Understood.Everyone stay perfectly still.Got it.Impressive thinking.In truth,I almost forgot this was all your fault.My fault?Listen, you green skinned, overgrown,poor excuse for a cyborg.- Where do you get off telling me...- Nope, I'm done.You're done. Training over.- You two are out.- But_Disappointment doesn't evenbegin to cover your actions.We will deal with you in the morning.Until then...Hey, don't beat yourself up.Honestly, you are not the first personto get into a fight with brainiac 5.- Really?- Are you serious?Mr. ""I'm more logical than thou?""He's a jerk who thinkshe's better than everyone.No one wants him around.Not even timber wolfand the other legionnaires.I mean, hejust doesn't belong here.What?Supergirl. You coming?Like I said, we've got to go before allthe good seats are taken.Proty.Where are you?Please come back before Ihave to tell dawnstar I lost you again.Here, proty, proty, proty.You good little, uh, thing.Ugh.You know what? I'm cold and tired.Let's give ourselves one more minute,then figure out a wayto blame bouncing boy for this.There you are.What the heck?Hey, brainiac 5. Look, I'm...I was kind of a jerk to you.I mean, you were a biggerjerk to me.Brainiac 5.I think we got off on the wrong foot,but I think we're morealike than you know and...Why is this so hard?Brainiac 5, I'm sorry.Can we start over?What are you doing?Go away. This doesn't concern you.Uh-huh.Because it lookslike you're trying to...I don't...Proty?What are you doing out?Is she...She... she can't be.I'm too late.You won't be needing this.Stay back, Supergirl.Brainiac 5 is not who he pretends to be.He planted a virusin our computer system.It's why we haven't been able to reachthe rest of the legion.And no one votedto let him join the academy.He hacked in and changed the tally.All for this.To break into the vault and stealthe weapons inside for some sick plot.We moved as fast as we couldonce we knew, but...Poor triplicate girl paid the pricefor our stupidityin trusting a brainiac.Yes, I hacked your computers,but I did not kill triplicate girl.This is the work of the dark circle.They've been planningto infiltrate the legion...You expect us to believe that?You have to! I would never hurt...You're just another clone gone bad.We'll be at the holding cells.Put hq on lockdown.We'll break the news in the morning.Wait. This doesn't make any sense.Why would brainiac 5 go to the vault,kill triplicate girl and then walk away,only to come backjust in time to get caught?She clearly surprisedhim the first time.He stupidly panicked,then came back to finish the job.Exactly. That's stupid,and brainiac 5 isn't stupid.What if he wasn't lying?I feel like I've heard the namedark circle before. It's...Familiar somehow.Brainiac 5 is evil.You were right.Go back to the dorms.It's over now.Training room, access library databanks.Bring up any informationyou have on the dark circle.Accessing files on the dark circle.Searching. Searching.Found.The dark circle. A terrorist cult.The dark circle has gone by many namesover the centuries.The black zero. The ouroboros.The beginning. The end.But they are always identifiedby the same symbol.Who are they?Fanatics, pursuing an unknown goal.Over the centuries,they emerge to wreak havoc,blowing up buildings,providing weapons of advanced originto other terrorist groups.There are even reports of themappearing as observers.Watching.Waiting.Then they vanish. No trace to be found.Leader, unknown. Origins, unknown.End of file.Powering down.Huh?I've seen them, the dark circle,in the past and also here, now.You said I'm too late.Too late for what?What's going on?I'm not going anywhere, so talk.You're relentless. You know that, right?Created by the god-likecontrollers of oa,the miracle machine allowsa user to bend reality to their will.Its original purpose disappearedwith the controllers.Since then,it has been used as a weaponof mass destruction.The legion managedto get their hands on it,and placed it in the vault.I overheard my family making plansto break into the vaultand steal the machinefor the circle's leader.I couldn't let that happen.So, logically,there was only one thing to do.Enroll myself in the academyand take the machine before they did.Wouldn't the logical thing have beento just tell the legion?Ah, yes, let's try that.""Hi, I'm the grandson of one of earth'sgreatest villains.My family is psychotic,and I need you to let me take a weaponof mass destruction.""Why would they believe me?No one ever does.I'm sure you assume I'm lying too, so...You know, just go.Come on. If the dark circle is here,we don't have very much time.What are you doing?I'm helping you break into the vaultand get the machine.If they had it,they'd have used it by now.I think we can still beat them.No, I mean, why?Because I believe you.Timber wolfand the others will be patrolling.How are we going to get past themwithout my belt?And this is humiliating.This is fun!I had a nightmare like this once.If you don't stop complaining,I'll start flying upside down.All right, the coast is clear.Wait...Supergirl, I...Logically, you have no reasonto help me,but you are.So, for my previous actions,- I'm sorry...- Shh.Are you trying to get caught?Keep it down.Mon El?I heard timber wolfand the others talkingas I was heading back to the dorms.I know everything and I want to help.I trust Supergirl.If she thinks you're innocent,then I do too.That's great!We could definitely use help.Right, brainy?Yeah. Great.Of course!So, what are we doing?Breaking the universe's most unbreakablesecurity system.- What is this?- This is the security code.The vault has a two-step process.First, the laser grid, then this.Break the code and a door will openinto the exact chamber we want.But we only have a shortwindow of time.How short?If I don't break this in the next30 seconds, they kill us.Can you do it?I'm brainiac 5.The universe'sonly 12th-level intelligence.I can do anything.Incredible.The code is a holographic neural overlaydesigned to cook the user's brain,unless they can decrypt while keepinga mental lock on their objective.This is...Going to take longer than I thought.How much longer?More than 30 seconds.Keep working on the code.I'll take out the robots.Whatever you do, don't destroy them.The instant one breaks,it'll trigger a purgeof the entire room.Brainy, I'm not greatat gently fighting things.Just try!Not to rush you, but hurry it up.I'm trying.The code keeps resetting.Got it!That's it.Whoo!We did it!We did it.We certainly did.Brainiac 5 broke the code...And the circle remains unbroken.Kara!What are you doing?For the universe'sonly 12th-level intellect,you sure are dumb, aren't you?I'm in the dark circle.I'd stop moving so much if I were you.It spreads the kryptonitefrom the dagger faster.Why?Of all people,you should understand.Your culture was the greatestthe universe had ever seen.Orderly. Uniform. Pure.But this world we live in,this world is rotten.The legion is the heart of the rot,encouraging losers like triplicate girland bouncing boy.They delude misfits into thinkingthey can be heroes,when they're just freaks.Now, the dark circlewill take over.We, who are superior,will lead the way...Elevating the world to heightsnot seen since the Kryptonian empire.The legion has fallen.The time of freaks has ended.As for you two,our leader would like a word.Hold on, Kara.Just hold on.Be silent in the presenceof the beginning and the end.Hello, grandson.Brainiac.No, impossible.You're dead.You died in the 2ist century!The kryptonite bulletwent through my brain, yes,but there was enough leftto rebuild around the damage.And a genius like myself nevergoes without a backup plan.I created the dark circlea 1,000 years pastto carry out my vision for a new world.It was the circle who stole my brainout of my old body.It was they who regrew it,tending to me over the centuries.But all would be for naughtif it weren't for you.What do you mean?Did you think you justhappened to overhearour plans to take the miracle machine?The other cloneswere mere 10th-level intelligences.There was only one being in the universewho could break the security code.You.We used you to get the machine.Were...You said my clone siblingswere 10th-level.Where are they?Hmm.Right here.By the time my brain finished regrowing,my old body was useless.The circle cloned me,and I picked the best partsfrom each to build a new one.They weren't pleasedwhen they found out.You lied to us.Stay away!Stay away from me!No! No! God, no!But, logically,what other purpose could you serve?The fools thoughtthey were being groomedas the next leader of the dark circle.For hubris alone, they deserve death.I am the most advancedmind that has ever existed.Thus, logically, I must be the oneto purge the universe of chaos and rot.For those who are superiorwill lead the wayto a pure and orderly future.The only one strong enoughto stop me was Supergirl.So, we watched herand found her weakness.Kryptonite.And your drive to helpthose more pathetic than yourself.You're a monster.I am a hero.There are threats on the horizononly I can counter.When I bend reality to my will,all will laud me as their savior.Once Supergirl is dead,I will incorporate you into my body.The son will become the father,and the circle will remain unbroken.Find them.I will begin to attunemyself to the machine.Hurts.It's going to be okay.I just need to get the kryptoniteout of your wound, all right?No! I'm working on something,but you've got to stay awake.Kara.Kara?Trying to.Keep talking.Talking to people is not my strong suit.Could I listchemical compositions instead?No, no, no. Kara!Stay with me.I'm sorry.I was wrong about everything.I'm supposed to be smart and logical,but my plan to stop the dark circlewasn't logical.It was me tryingto prove to everyone that I...I'm not my family.I'm not just another evil clone.But I'm not. I messed it up.I'm not like you.You're so confident,and brilliant,and strong, and...And?And beautiful.And?And I can't think straightwhen you smile at me.- Well, there you two are.- Finally.Good work, pg.- Triplicate girl?- You're alive.Yeah, no thanks to mon El!You know that son of a bitch killed me?You know, I saw him meeting upwith those people in masks.I peeled off an extra meright before I got to the vaultand he killed my third self.So, I need you nerdsto come up with a planto save the dayso I can kill him right back.Did I mention, I'm going to kill him?Yeah, only about,like, a million times.Invisible kid?In the flesh.Phantom girl found triplicate girlright before the attack.I managed to turn invisible and escape.And the three of ushave been hiding ever since.And your clothes are...On! The clothes are on!I turned all of me invisible this time.See, I told you.I told you I almost had it.So, the teachers are knocked out,the rest of the academymembers are trapped,and I am just itchingto give mon e! A little...Payback.What happened to,""we're waiting-list material?""No. Screw that. I'm pissed.Now, we're kicking-ass material.The legion is gone.It's up to us.So, let's go be heroes.You've got an idea, don't you?I have the beginnings of a plan,yes, but_We'll need all the academymembers to pull it off.Yeah. Uh, excuse me.Is the plan to flirt forever?Because we're kindof in a time crunch here, lovebirds.Oh, that's not I... I mean...It's okay.What do you need us to do?I can't find a traceof the legion anywhere.Then let me.Still nothing...Quadrant beta, orbiting the black starby planet winath.Encrypting message,compensating for cosmic interferencefrom the black hole, and the sos is...Sent.- Yes!- Yeah! All right!Now, the hard part.Keep searching.Brainiac has almost finishedsyncing to the machine.We can't let them ruin this now.You mean us?Get them!Nice try.Move away from the machine, brainiac.It's over.No.It is just beginning.I see it.The shape of all things.An endless circle,which I break and form anew.Those deluded enoughto think themselves my equal will fall.As will thosestrong enough to ever pose a threat.And any world that could ever disruptthe dominance of brainiac!I thought I was brilliant before,but I was nothing.Now, I am the supreme being!Hardly.You just happen to be the oneholding the machine.I always thoughtus clones surpassed you.You were copies of greatness.I am the mastermind of reality.I am the leader of the dark circle.I am...The greatest mindthe universe has ever known!I am greater than what came before me.I am a 10th-level intellectand you are nothing.No! You serve me.Your wills are no match for mine!You are obsolete.As long as the miracle machineis in this reality,it will obey the willof its last user.And that will be me, not you.No, it will be me.I am the heir to the dark circle!I alone will rule this new reality.No, iwill.Stop!You will destroy us, you idiots!There can only be...Oneleaderwho's it going to be?It's not stopping.Brainiac 4 was right.The machine won't stopuntil reality unravels.How is this the only thingI'm not able to break?Mom?I... I could bring her back.I could bring Krypton back.But it won't stop reality from breaking.Imiss you...Every single day.I wish things were different.But Krypton is gone.And I'm needed here.I have to let you go now...And save the world.I just hope I've made you proud.Always, my Kara, always.The miracle machinewill continue to destroy everythingas long as it's in this reality.- So...- Let's will it into a different one.Thank you.For what?I got ya, triplicate girl!Thanks, bouncy.It's duplicate girl now.I like the new name.What about ""duo damsel?""Ya know, alliteration's kinda cool.Never mind.Wait. We're picking new names?Then from now on,I am arms fall off man!Oh. All right. I love it!I thought you saidthey were useless!They... they were.Retreat! Everyone, fall back!Oh, no, you don't. Pg, here!Hey, guys.Save any for us?There's still time to change your mind.There will always be a placein the dark circlefor those with true power.You and I could lead it.And bring back the pride of Krypton.Oh, mon El, you'rejust wrong.Hey there, mon El.Where are you going?Shit.That's the last of themfor the holding cells.All that's left to do is wait for...Damn.I vote they allget in as full legionnaires.I'm sorry we couldn't bringKrypton back.Or your mother.If you want,I could start researchinga way to replicate the machine.I mean, logically,it would be a terrible idea but...It's okay.Earth's not so bad. It's...Definitely got a couple of good points.Interesting.In the name of research,we better add to those points.Genius idea.And then duplicate girl shot him!And then she shot him again.In retrospect, I think it was a mistaketo let her keep that gun.But saturn girl was still thrilled!That's great, Kara.Seems like beinga legionnaire really suits you.Oh, and brainy's been making tonsof upgrades on legion hq,including rigging up the time bubblesso we can talk more.Here, hold on.What are you... Kara.Kal, I'd like you to meet brainiac 5,the universe's only 12th-level intellectand my boyfriend.It's... it's an honor to meet you.I mean, talk...Uh...Sir.I'm happy to meet you, brainiac 5.Uh, but if you two will excuse me,I've got to get back to being...Superman.- Of course.- Bye, kal.Talk soon.You didn't tell her?How am I supposed to askher to come back to the 2ist centurywhen we still don't knowwhat's happening?"

There'll be girls.- You're not going to Schooler Paradise.- Surfer's Paradise.You promised us you studied.- You lied to your family.- Our entire family is full of doctors.Don't we have enough?- What are you going to be then, huh?- I don't know.My sister in China has bought aticket to come to your graduation.- What am I going to tell her?- You can tell her about Schooler's Paradise.Fine! I'll pay you back.Every last cent.What did they expect?The average personlies six times a day.And I only cheated that one time.I guess you gotta start somewhere.- What the hell!- You want a phone, you need a job.You want a job, you need an education.- Chinese lucky money?- Call as soon as you get there.With what?Try to be a good boy.Look at these monkeys. They thinkthey get something for nothing.But they're just idiots for us to laugh at.You need to work hard for what you want.Life is not a game show.Lawrence, just because your fathersent you here as a punishmentdoes not mean you cannot have fun.I can put on my computerfor you to play on.- Do you have a modem?- No, Lawrence.A Macintosh.Uncle Sam loved chess.I mean, really loved it.Chess taught him everythingthat was important in life...discipline, tradition,self-control.I want to die.Lawrence, Soo Jin is our club champion.Lawrence is very smart.Make a good Chinese boyfriend.I will leave you two kids together.I'm sure you'll have lots to talk about.- She's eight.- No, Soo Jin is 10, and I'm 52.Anyone who can beat youruncle in a game of chessmust have something worthwhile to say.That's the spirit.Excuse me, sir.If you're not here to play chess,I'm going to have to ask you to leave.My good man, I am here to play.A visitor's game is five dollars.Who's the president ofthis fine establishment?- I am.- Oh, excellent.You're a man of chess, no less.A yellow Kasparov.I, too, am quite the mastereven if I do say so myself, which I do!I've not been beaten for nine years.This is a tragedy, butI've come all the way...to the antipodes for a new challenge.Mr. President, I propose to you a wager.Defeat me in a single game,and you can ram-jamramabam these 50 clams...into your old skyrocket.I don't play for money.Oh!So who is the best player in the club?- Me!- Ah!I won the club championship three times.Oh, my.Delighted to meet you, young lady.Enough!In that case, I shall defeat you all.This is a serious club.Very well.

Very clever.Why would you be followingan old drunk down an alley?I'm a good judge of character, young man,and you don't look like a ruffian to me.- You forgot something.- Ah, my whiskey!Thank you.Your cold tea.A harmless little deceptionin order to lower theexpectations of one's adversaries.You're very perceptive for ayoung man who doesn't play chess.Neither do you.But you just saw me play 10 games at once.I'm the grand pooh-bah.I haven't lost a match in 12 years.- Nine years.- Well, time flies when you're having fun.You didn't win 10 games. Youdidn't win any games at all.You played them against each other.You watched the move oneplayer made against you...and copied it on the opposite board.Of course you wouldwin half the games.And you beat my unclebecause you played himagainst the club champion.Checkmate. Yes!Lawrence, isn't it?Well, Lawrence, you've busted my gaffe.You're Joe hep. You're hep to the game.And your keen eye has earnedyou a pineapple here tonight.Would you mind?So you walk in, steal their moneyand walk away just like that?Lawrence, that hurts.I didn't break any of theTen Commandments tonight.I didn't murder anybody.I didn't covet my neighbor's donkey,and I certainly didn't steal anything.You've just insulted anold man who gave you $50.My uncle's $50.The lure of easy money...clouds rational thought.You cannot cheat an honest man.That is the first rule of my occupation.A con man.I prefer the term ""professional liar.""- Lawrence!- I should go... Wait!- My money.- Easy come, easy go.That also tends to be something of a rule.I need that money.If you want to earn it back,Sunday morning at the mall.Good evening, Lawrence.Come on, mate.Good morning.Good morning, young man.It's Lawrence.What are you doing here?You said you might need a hand.What kind of hand?With whatever scam you've got going on.Do you think you mightlike to speak up a little?I don't think everybody quite heard you.Look about you.

Yeah, sure.When the moment was right,the Professor wouldbarge into the room,claiming to be her father.The Badger was the onetime he told the truth.Oh, no.He'd tell some storyabout how she was only 16,threaten to talk to hisfamily, his work, the press.And the sucker would always pay.Through the nose.

        How did Reger get the positionof Hofkapellmeister in Meiningen?And who did he succeed as a conductor?Reger had already performedwith members of the court orchestra.He said the only orchestra he really wantedto lead was the Meininger Hofkapelle.When the position was put out to tenderlots of people applied, but Reger didn't.However he let it be knownthat he was interested.Reger's predecessor Fritz Steinbachwas his great advocate.He recommended Reger to the Duke.The Duke was rather sceptical becauseReger's reputation was so ambivalent.To some he was an upcoming composer......to others he was a ""destroyer of music""while others saw him as a traditionalist.



And they were all agreedthat he drank to much.Steinbach had to dispel all these doubts......and maintain that Reger was the bestfor the court orchestra and for him.And finally he convinced the Duke.The Duke liked Reger from the startand called him a great original......and no mere courtier.Reger did not approve of the Dukebecause of his assumed ""divine origin"".He saw himself as an artist gifted by Godand therefore the Duke's equal.As for family life... well,when was Reger at home?Reger's children did not attend a public school.Elsa herself was against it.Elsa herself blossomed in court life butReger could not stand it at all.Here we have the orchestra scheduleof one of the concert tours......of the Meininger Court Orchestra.



And I see there were 22 concerts in 20 days.Is that true?That's right.The Meininger Court Orchestra did enjoy workingwith Reger in such an intense way.Reger on the other hand learned a lot throughthis concentrated daily intensive work.He also recognised what could be expectedof the orchestra and what could be implemented.Above all, he had a strict orchestra disciplineduring both concerts and rehearsals.Through this approach he developed the famous""dreifache Meininger piano"" (pianopianissimo).That means the orchestra really changedand developed under Reger's leadership.Yes, the general opinion was that the orchestrahad stagnated a little before Reger took over.But I believe it was actuallygoing in a different direction.Reger with his tendency to extremes......wanted to be able to hear a pin dropAND the music too!He gained considerable experience workingday to day with the court orchestra.He therefore knew how to orchestratethe sounds he had in mind.In this respect it's a perfect song.I see ""An die Hoffnung"" as a preparationfor the Romantic Suite.For me, both are night-time chants.Therefore ""Tristan"" comes into picture......and I think you can hear throughout thatReger from the outset was a great Wagnerian.Originally Reger wanted to composea recitative and an aria.Karl Straube had suggested Friedrich Hölderlin'sode, ""An die Hoffnung"" (To Hope).In Reger's hands it developed into somethinga bit different to a recitative and an aria.As he often did, Reger altered the lyricsthat he was adapting......to an extent that the sense of the poemwas given a different direction.For example, in the Hölderlin poem it reads...""....there in the silence, sweet hope,I will LOOK for you.""Reger changes this to,""...I will FIND you.""A major difference.At the end of the poem he adds a whole line,""...oh hope, oh hope, sweet, sweet hope.""As if he could not live with the suspended,unredeemed thought of life beyond death.I think this is amongst Reger'smost personal vocal works.I always have the feeling that the poem found him,as it seems so close to the depth of his soul.To my mind, there is a certain meeting of soulsbetween Böcklin and Reger......Reger´s ideal to live solely for his artis also expressed in the painting.But there are other relationshipsthat have been neglected......namely the irony in Böcklin's work.Even though this has been forgotten.If you have a look at the Böcklin picturewith its remarkable creatures frolicking in the water......it's actually really funny!That was the kind of humour Reger could also relate to!""Maria Wiegenlied"" Opus 76/52,composed in 1912 in Berchtesgaden.""The most popular da capo lied in the concertsof the most famous female singers......More than 100,000 copies sold!""That was the slogan onthe special advertising print of this lied.Already in Reger's lifetime this becamehis most famous lied.It was a hit.And why was that?It's the wonderfully deep and intimate melodythat travels straight to the ear......and in its great chastenessis anything but simple.No other lied by Reger has been arrangedfor such a variety of instruments.Anyone who listens to a performanceof Reger's unfinished requiem ""Dies Irae""......or better ""the abruptly discontinued"" requiem......is changed somehow.What is ""Dies Irae"" all about?I actually attended the premiere.That took place at the end of the seventies......because up to then there hadn't beena musical score available.The performance was recorded on vinyl.It was reviewed by one critic who said tellingly......that he always had the feeling that the Great Warhad failed to leave its mark in the music.There wasn't anything like Remarque's book""All Quiet on the Western Front"".What existed in literature, didn't exist in music.Now the critic was relieved because this pieceappeared as world war in its purest form.And indeed, one is squashedagainst the wall and appalled.No other work of Reger is as expressive.It also leads into new areasof sound and composition...Such that one thinks, Reger old chap,couldn't you have continued with that......and not been dissuaded?Then that would have turned intosomething even greater.""I think Straube had a very different tasteconcerning choir music.He simply couldn't follow Reger'smodern musical language anymore.Even though he understoodhis organ works so well......which were also highly expressive.I don't accept that Regerwas no match for the text.Reger was certainly Catholic enoughto know his Latin texts quite well.Before he started, he consulted a cleric......who indeed translated the Requiemword by word for him.To me it also sounds rather literal......at least according to Reger's ideas......and not necessarily to others.He himself said, having moved to Jena,""Now Reger's free Jena style begins!""He was referring to a violin sonata,which he composed there......which also remained a fragment.After the Requiem he was not even ableto finish a violin sonata.That's how depressive he was– it was a real creative crisis.But now came the move away fromthe town and court society.He couldn't deal with the court societywhich disgruntled and annoyed him many times.He was no court clerk.And now being in a city like Jenawhich championed a freedom of mind......since Schiller, at the latest!Exactly!He knew that the Republic of Letterswas awaiting him.Since his breakthroughhe had always been welcomed......especially by the academics.And those he found concentrated in Jena.This was the atmosphere of freedom of mindthat he was hoping for......and of course the freedomof not being employed anymore......not being forced to fulfil the demands of others.He called himself ""Freiherr Reger"" (Baron Reger)– literally a freeman.Mostly he felt free to not have to fightat the sharp end of modernism anymore.He gave up on that.In 1910 Schoenberg wrote his first atonal pieces.Reger commented...""I'm not sure whether this is still music– it really makes one turn to conservatism!""So this was the freedom he was giving himselfto go on in his compositions the Reger way.That meant to permanently improve,from work to work.In May of 1915, almost exactlyone year before Reger died......he wrote this lied and dedicated it tohis godchildren Hedwig and Max-Martin Stein.It is one of the ""Fünf neue Kinderlieder""(Five New Children's Songs), Opus 142a.The letter ""A"" seems like a message to Gretel,the mother of Hedwig and Max-Martin Stein......as if to say, ""Please, write many more poems!""Because it was Reger's plan to writeanother 50 children's songs......which was not meant to be.Stylistically these five Lieder are actually acontinuation of the ""Schlichte Weisen"".The last of those five, ""Bitte""is also Reger's last ever lied.Based on a poem of Adele Holst.On the outside it seems likea somewhat naïve or childlike prayer.But close to the end, the dimensionsof the lied expand......so that the angels may""...gently guide someone on his path to God.""Reger's first lied was a prayer, a hopeful,life-affirming one asking for happiness.His last lied has a typical Reger harmonicwith a rather homeopathic dose.It asks for safe conduct into death.The ever-present death in war at that time......as well as his life-long sense of limited timemay have had an internal effect.On May 11th 1916, Reger died at 43 years old.Had there been any premonition for him?It was long predicted but neverthelessterrible and surprising for everyone.On his bedside table they found......the corrections of his wonderful choir chantthat he composed at the start of World War I......entitled, ""Mankind Lives and ThrivesOnly a Short While"".We have this proof sheet......and I always get goose bumps looking at it,realising how things fell into place.That almost seems stagedbut I am sure it wasn't!No, it's certainly true.It was witnessed by many people.Max Klinger made a drawingof him on his deathbed......and a famous photographer was present.It is all accurately documented.Why is Reger so important to you?I think he has an ingenious wayof combining intellect with emotion.He mastered the craft and was ableto evoke emotions......and for me this is a great combination.Reger never set up a school of music makingeven though he had 300 students.There are repeated generations who havetaken on aspects of his work.He remains interesting and new generationscan always find something important in his work......and that is a result of his complexity.Above all, I think that he will never bea composer for the masses.He's too intellectual for that.But there is always a certain group of peoplewho are interested in his music......and above all, that's the performers.As I see it, Reger's future lies in the handsof those who are engaged with him.I can only speak as an interpreter.With a view to the overall developmentof the last decades one still has to say...""If the mountain won't come to the prophet,the prophet must come to the mountain.""In other words, we have to listen to himtime and time again.Only by listening to him more,can he no longer be overlooked."

What do you think?Now, listen, the reason that Mimi......your mother, hasn't been able to......visit you....

Pull around.Here we go.-We have guests behind us.-The guests. I see.Are you two in school or something?I'm at Columbia,and as far as this year's challenge for lgby......we're still waiting to hear backfrom this fun parochial school in DC.-""Perchance to dream.""-He's done the Protestant circuit.Mom must have some photos of thehead priest with an altar boy for them......to even be considering lgby.-We're all at a bit of a loss as to---Whenever I'm at a loss, I dip into Rilke.Rilke? That tortures me.Every Christmas, some assholegives me this copy of Young Poet......with this patronizing note on the flapabout how it's supposed to change my life.-Maybe you should read it before judging it.-I'm pretty confident.After all, one of the copies was from you.I'm Oliver, and this is my little brother, lgby.What kind of a name is ""lgby""?It's the kind of a name that someonenamed Sookie is in no position to question.Sookie?-Where do you go to school?-Bennington.Ollie's majoring in Neo-Fascismat Columbia.-Economics.-Semantics.-What's your major?-Attitude.-I've gotta get back to the bar.-That's where I'm headed.Catch you kids later.D.H. brings you up a lot.-Captain Charisma is my godfather.-I know.So, if something horrible, God forbid......were to befall my mother,I would live with him and Bunny.-I know what godparents are.-You're ripping apart my potential home.-My being here offends you?-Your being here is great.-I had no choice.-No, really. I think you're great.Thank you.It's him bringing you here that tortures me.I love the fact that the captainof the morality team invites his chick......to the same party as his wife, who isn'tthe sharpest tool in the shed anymore.And what's more, none of their supposedmutual friends protects her.None of them bats a fucking eyelashat his hypocrisy. I love that, I really do.Embrace your moral hypocrisy,D.H. Go for it.-But me you're okay with.-Honestly.Listen, you know what?If you're ever in the city,you should pop by the loft.We're done working on it.I know.No worries, Mother.Igby is on his way to the airport.The driver's been briefedto take him directly to LaGuardia.He'll be in St. Anthony's loving custodyby this afternoon.And happy birthday, Mother.Much love.Sir?It's my mother's birthday today, and I forgot.Is there any way that......we could just......make a quick stopin the city somewhere, so......I can get her something?She'd be so surprised.Can I help you?Hey.You remember me?From the Hamptons John Birch Cotillion.Yeah.

I work here.I pay rent.D.H. doesn't even know you're here?It's kind of awkward.Great.I don't know what you're gonna do,because there isn't an extra key......and only D.H. can get them made, so....There's an extra key on the windowsillin the hallway, the landing outside the door.But it has to be here when D.H. needs it.-Why would D.H. need it?-Fuck you!You can stay here for a couple daysand that's it.Contrary to popular belief,D.H. is my landlord.I'm an established artist. I work here.My projects are supported.I can't afford to fuck up my relationshipwith my landlord. Do you understand?So, let yourself in and out......with the key,but each time he reaches for it...-...it's there waiting for him.-Sure.I don't wanna know you're hereor see any traces of you in here.Gotcha.For a couple of days.I'm just gonna run to the bathroom.So, you're an artist?What kind of art?What do you mean, ""what kind of art""?I mean do you paint, or what?I got what you meant,but you obviously didn't get what I meant.An artist creates art,regardless of what form the canvas takes.-So, what do you do?

They're great.-Thank you.It's incredible that a human beingcould make such neat little joints.You make it sound as ifI'm anal or something.-Just because I can roll a perfect joint.-Not anal.Vegetarian.What does that mean?You don't rollbig Rasta spliff joints, do you?Your joints are like salad joints,not like a big......sloppy, bleeding-cheeseburger-that-you-rip-into-kind-of-a-joint joint.I guess marijuanaisn't a visceral experience for me.-Sex is for me.-Right.Okay, so I am a vegetarian.But for purely moral reasons.I thought you went to schoolat Brandeis or someplace.Bennington. I do.-Why aren't you there?-I took a semester off.I needed time to recuperate.From what?Entenmann's cookies,beer, diet pills, tension......Iife.My dad's been recuperating for six years.What do you mean?From life. Nothing.Let's go.You've come a long way, baby.You're funny.Hello, I'm Lt. Ernest Smithfrom Pershing Academy.-I'm here to ask about a---Those are fabulous.-Where did you get them?-The army.See, I'm regular army.Mrs. Slocumb found outI was stationed in New Jersey now......so she just thought that maybe lgby,since he worked here this summer....Can I have these?No.I'm asking about lgby Slocumb!Anne Frank, the soldiers are gone.Come out and play.Yum, with three ""M""s.You have a huge crush on me, don't you?Fuck off.How's your brother doing these days?-I don't have a brother. I'm an only child.-Oliver's your brother, I thought.-He is, and yet....-And yet what?I was about to say that we wereboth raised only children, but......that sounds like somethingyou would say.What do you do?I'm preparing to leave.Where do you want to go?Far away.I was thinkingabout joining the Peace Corps.Go on my Razor's Edge experience.Discover the meaning of life.Whatever.You need at least three years of collegeto join the Peace Corps, don't you?You do?Yeah. I had a friend at school who joined.That could be a slight snag.I haven't even gotten aroundto taking my GED yet.-So take it.-I gotta go to Hackensack.So go! Stop procrastinating.It's almost Christmas.Not going to New Jersey isn'tprocrastinating. It's common sense.-Do you want me to go with you?-No.I will.All right, that'd be great.Why aren't you in school now?Sheer ingenuity.You're funny.Instead of sayingthat someone or something is funny......why don't you just laugh?-ls that better?-Much.-Gosh, I've never been to a hideout before.-Shut up.My boy......you look a bit......peaked.I don't feel peaked.Say......give your....Give your mother a call.Let her know you're alive, yes?You need to eat some red meat, my boy.You're all pale.I didn't know he was here.The key was on the window.We had lunch. I let him in.How was I supposed to know that?It wasn't my fault.-We had an agreement. You fucked up.-lt wasn't my fault.You fucking idiot!So....I guess you have to pay rent this month.Rachel, stop.She's a......dancer who doesn't dance, and......her friend is a painter who doesn't paint.It's kind of a boho version ofIsland of the Lost Toys.And she's a lot stronger than she looks.I broke my butt!You know what I think aboutwhen I'm this close to another body?I think......one day......at one moment......this body that I'm holding in my armswill stop breathing......stop living......just......stop.One day, you'll see my name in the obitsand you'll remember this moment.You're a real fuckin' upper.How did you end up at military school?Mimi.-Mimi?-My mother.You call your mother ""Mimi""?""Heinous One"" is a bit cumbersome.Right.""Medea"" was already taken.Your mother sent you to military school?In all fairness to her, I did get kicked outof most of the schools on the East Coast.Still, I just assumed that military schoolwas an empty threat, like with most parents.She called that bluff.Do you resent her for sending you there?I'm glad I went.It made everything clear to me.Like what?The fight.-15 minutes.-Okay.Downstairs, dressed,waiting for your father, in 15 minutes......or you're taking the bus.I know.Dad?You see......Igby......I feel this......great......pressure......coming down on me.It's just constantly coming down on me......crushing me.You make it sound sinister. That'swhat good schools are for, to shape you......not brainwash youin some evil, Orwellian way, or......squash youinto something you're not, but....I know my motherteaches metaphysical poetry at Vassar.I really believe she tries--My father went through the system andit told him what he was supposed to want.He achieved everything, and......then in his 40s, he flipped.What did he really want?Sunny days.Now Dad is in the Maryland Homefor the Befuddled.Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.So, you're never going back to school?What are you planning to do with your life,lgby? Just kill time until--My nervous breakdown comes along?Is your father dead?No, why?'Cause when I talked about mine, you didn'tfeel obligated to compare and contrast.He's a theologian.A Jewish theologianand a metaphysical poetess.Doesn't explain you.What would?Cross-dressing psychoanalysts?Heroin junkies?-I don't know.-Thanks.My parents......were two......very idealistic, incredibly bright......narcissists.I was like their vanity project.-Oh, my God.-What?You torture me.I was adopted, okay?That would explain everything.'Cause, I mean,how many Vassar professors......and intellectual theologiansbeget nymphomaniacal......pseudo-bohemian J.A.P.s?Actually, a lot, probably, right?I'm not a J.A.P.-Good morning. I'm Oliver. We met at the---Right.At that party in the Hamptons.-You're the fascist brother.-He prefers ""Young Republican.""I'm Sookie.Excuse me. I've got to....I'm sorry.-God, you're pathetic.-Thank you, fuckwit.D.H. told you I was here?Your little vacation's about tocome to a rather abrupt and severe end.Come again?You're still a minor.So?Since you're not interestedin taking care of your education......measures are being taken on your behalf.What measures?Mom's coming up next weekend.Great.-I'm taking my equivalency test on Friday.-Whatever.I can vouch,because I made the appointment.-Really?-Really.Oh, my God! It's almost the afternoon.Look, it was...-...nice meeting you. I'm gonna take off.-Where are you headed?My mom's. Upper East Side.Me, too. That's where I'm staying.Amidst the cobwebs and geriatrics.The geriatrics?Everyone's inferior to Ollie in some way.Ask him, he'll tell ya.Let me give you a lift.It's a write-off for D.H.You can't pass up a free ride.-Friday?-Friday.See ya.It's not his real name.He had a stuffed bear as a kid, Digby Bear.They were British, I think.And because he always got everythingwrong, he called it ""lgby.""Whenever he committed a crime,he would say, ""l didn't do it, lgby did.""And to break him of this habit,being as hip to child psych as she was......Mimi started referring to him as lgbyevery time he lied.He lied a lot.So, you work for your godfather?Igby's, D.H., who is amazing.His mind functions only to make money.He thinks he has everythinghe could possibly want......so he walks around acting the way hethinks a happy and content man should act.He's a parody.-lf he's a parody, why do you work for him?-He's an obscenely rich parody.And if he wants to make mein his image, hey.What does your mother do?She's a writer,though mostly she just teaches now.Is she divorced?Never married.-How come?-Doesn't like men.-Lesbian.-No.Just a failed heterosexual.Listen, thanks for the lift.Shit!What, did you lose your wallet?I don't have the keysto my aunt's apartment.-The doorman won't let you in?-He's totally senile, never remembers me.I'll just wait for her.Wander around.She'll be in this evening at some point.-Are you sure?-Yeah.-Could I use your phone?-Sure.I mean, God.Can I get a receipt?Mimi......had been afraid someonewould find something embarrassing.So up went her little soldier......while she waited downstairs.This old lady led me to his desk.And before she left me there, made sureto give me a nice pat on the head.I wanted to break her fucking hand.So, I sat down in my father's chairand I started looking in his desk.Each drawer that I opened was the same.No books, no pencils......just row upon rowof meticulously stacked cigarettes.Thousands of them.And all I could think was......not the extent to whichmy father's sickness had damaged him......but rather:""Gosh...""...how would somebody do this withoutanyone in the office being the wiser?""You know, not ""my father's so far fuckinggone, he ain't never comin' back...""...but just:""How the fuckdid he get all of these cigarettes...""...into this desk?""You were numb.Sookie......I am numb.-Everything all right here, folks? You okay?-Great.Excuse me! I'm sorry.Do you want me to give this to youor should I hang on to it?I want you to pin it to my lapelwith my mittens and nametag.-Snippy. No bus-ride treat for you.-Shut up!You're being really immature about this.If I'm immature, you're prenatal.God, to be impressed by that preppy prick.We hung out. We're closer in age.He's your brother.You act like you hate him.I do!I do hate him. He's totally hateable.Evil, niblet fuck.There's been a misunderstanding.Next fall is not good.I need my son enrolled this spring.Have you spoken to his godfather,D.H. Banes?Igby is his favorite charity.He's sponsoring the boy, as in, financially.What do we have to do, then,to make it happen this spring?You do that.Thank you very much.Bye-bye.I'm goin' to California.I need a fuckin' sunny day.Can I come?I'm serious.There's nothing keeping me here.Except perhaps poverty.-Can't let that stop you.-I can't.I've always wantedto drive across the country.-Maybe this summer.-Fuck that. I'm flying.-I wanna come, asshole.-Good.'Cause I'd be afraid to go by myself.-May I freshen your drink?-A little baby portion, please.Bigger baby.Thank you.I must say......you have perfected the hobo look.You didn't buy the suit, did you?Someone left it someplace for you?Dad.How apropos.I want my money.My money from Dad.I'll get it in two years, anyway.-So you can extend your vacation?-I need it.You freed it up early for Ollie.Ollie graduated from high school.He graduated at the top of his class.He earned it.I'm not gonna subsidize your being a bum.-It's a moot point, anyhow.-What do you mean?You're assuming Jason provided for youin the same manner he provided for Ollie.Yes.He didn't.You're lying.Darling......why would I lie when I can just say ""no""?I've had a conversation with Mr. McKaye......headmaster of St. Anthony's, and in spiteof your little disappearing act this fall......he has agreed to admit youafter Christmas.-You'll be boarding there---I'm not going back.I passed the equivalency test.I don't have to go back.Of course, I don't trust you with the trainfare, so if you just look up Ollie......tell him that I will reimburse himif he buys your ticket.-I don't have his number.-D.H. does.If it had just occurred to meto mention it to Ollie.I saw him this afternoon,for lunch, with his girlfriend.In fact, you just missed him,darling, by about......an hour and a half.His Connecticut one?Though I rather liked her. This is a newone, a rather attractive New York girl, a......Jewish girl.You've reached my studio. If you want torent, leave your information after the beep.Otherwise, you know what to do.Honey? I hope I caught you.Guess where I am. St. Vincent's Hospital.We're having a party.Everybody is here, just fucking everybody.It's a party.A bad batch Mama sold you.But I caught you in time, right?You're not coming to this party, right?Hello, Bunny?

Thanks, D.H.-Please.I'm sorry I called like that.I didn't know what else to do.You did the right thing.I'm glad we were on the island.Good boy.Very good boy.You know, I was the best man at yourparents' wedding. Did you know that, lgby?The golden couple.That's what the paper called it.My boy.You know what I think you've been up to?I think you've been pissing......in the well from which you drink.That's what I think you've been up to.What happened?Breach of contract.D.H. did this to you?-I didn't know he could get angry.-He wasn't angry.He felt obligated.Not to worry. I doubt it will affectyour position as his prime punk.I think if Gandhi had had to hang outwith you for any prolonged period of time......he'd have ended upkicking the shit out of you.Fuckwit.Why?Rachel.You're screwing Rachel?You're screwing Rachel?Where was Rachelwhen all this was going on?OD'd.Is she dead?St. Vincent's.Unbelievable.Mom wanted me to escort you down to DC......and deliver you to St. Anthony's,but you can't travel now.At least not with me.I'm not going.

How natural!-Shut up!You think you're what he wants?You think that you fit the pictureof how he wants his life to look?You think that he would bring youback to our mother as a potential wife?Our mother?She'd be nice to your face,but the first opportunity......she'd pull him aside and warn him off.""Mongrel children have sucha hard time fitting in, dearest!""Shut up!He will lie to you!He will use you up and marry some inbred......Darien Frau who will beget himall the towheaded brats he can afford.Go away!They are rigid and they are cold!And you don't knowthey are cold to the fuckin' bone!I'm not going with you.I'm scared.You're just a glutton for fuckin' punishment,aren't you, lgs?Russel!I need a job!Hello?Lisa Fiedler's?I know a girl from Baltimore.So what?I know a girl from Baltimore.What are you talking about?I know a girl from Baltimore!So do I!Lisa, there's some guy here for you,but he keeps talking---Who is it?-I don't know.He's saying something about Baltimore?-The drugs!-The drugs!It's me.

Columbia, right?Right.We're all hopingthat once he's healed from the accident......that he'll be able to......Iead a fairly normal lifeand be able to go back to a--Oh, no!What happened?Apparently, as far as anyone can tell......he was 10-speeding a gazillion miles anhour through Central Park......racing with all the other Young Turks.He apparently caught his own reflectionin the handlebar mirror, and became so......aroused by itthat he burst his Speedo shorts......which then got caught in the gearsand just threw him on his face, splatter.Luckily, someone had the presence of mindto scrape his face off the pavement......and put it on ice.-Doctors were able to graft most of it back---I'm sorry.And you....This is what you're up to.Bigger-picture Darwinism.You two know each other.Wow!Igby Slocumb was in my art class.He was one of my students.You used to call me Miss Piggy, didn't you?Yeah.Do you want me to cut this for you?Fuck!Lucky Charms?What?Fuckin' Lucky Charms!I don't know.Psycho bitch!What did you do with her Lucky Charms?Nothing.She's a bit upset.Her one-woman show wasn't terriblywell received at The Pyramid tonight.Really?The world isn't ready for Peeka!-No?-I told her.Lorna Luft was just too fucking obscure.People just think you're doing a bad Liza.-I love Lorna.-Me, too.Your brother is looking for you.Your mom is dying.Yeah?Yeah.You know what you have to think of it as?What?Like an act of God.If there were a God,he'd have acted a lot sooner.-What?-Nothing.-He left you a ticket.-Excellent.It's non-refundable.He wanted me to tell you that.Dick.I gotta take a piss.Toilet paper?Here.It's Russel's.How are you doing?I'm pretty sensational, actually.And you?Good.Really.But....How is D.H.?Does he miss me?-I haven't spoken to him since---I bet he does.You're cute.Come on.Down.What?Your poor mother.I've been hoarding Seconallike a proper junkie.I'm ready.It's time to round up your brother.What's this?An ice-cream sundae.I accept.I'm going to DC this weekendand kill my mother.I'm shocked.Ollie called me.Apparently, he called everybody.Stole your thunder.Asshole.-This must be very hard on you.-Not as fucking hard as it's gonna be on her.-You're just angry and confused.-Oh, my God, don't do that to me.-What?-Psych 101 me.You're a furious boy. I mean,eventually you won't be a boy...-...and it'll eat you up.-Furious boy?The thoughtthat I'm going to live my life without......ever having told her to fuck off,is pretty goddamn infuriating.Do you hate my guts?For a month I did.Now you're not even in my top five.Good.I missed you.My life is, I don't know.I'm drowning in assholes.I'm your friend.Listen, after....I'm not coming back.

You bury her.I'm joking.Listen, I've got this discount fare, and......it'd be kinda hypocritical of me.You know.-You'll handle it like everything else, right?-Right.You should hate me.I don't.-You should.-I don't hate you.Don't be indulgent.Never that.-You're going to California?-Yep. The Sunshine State.Actually, Florida's the Sunshine State.Really?Three thousand fuckin' milesaway from here.Is there a number where we can reach you?We?

l am Chief Yeh Li Nieh Tangof the Royal Ching Palace.l have come especiallyto call on Master Cho of Wu Tang.His Majesty's health is ailing.We have long heard thatMaster Cho guards a majestic flowerthat has the powerto bring back even the dead.What is the time now?Oh, we are still four hoursaway from blossom.No, what year are we in?Master, we are exactly 10 yearsfrom the founding of the Ching Empire.10 years!You may all go now.Master, if only your majestic flowercould restore His Majesty's health,the palace will reward you handsomely.This flower is not for you!



Cho Yi Hang,did you hear what the Chief just said?Who could be more importantthan His Majesty?The person in my heart is a woman.l have waited here for her for a decade.l wonder if she knows...THE BRlDE WlTH WHlTE HAlRl was the student ofMaster Tzu Yang of Wu Tang.He was the Joint Chief of theEight Big Clans of Chung Yuan, our land.He was tireless in explaining to methe misgivings of our worldand the differencesbetween good and evil.Needless to say, in his words, withthe exception of the Eight Big Clans,all other clans are evil.Yi Hang, you must remember...Good and evil are like oil and water,they will never mix.Yes, Master.He'd always say the same thing,l'd always answer the same way.Have you mastered the Dragon MoonBreaking Sword steps l taught you?Yes, Master, to perfection.Yi Hang!Concentrate, heart and sword in one.Draw!The sword protects the bodyeven from falling petals.Heart-piercing precision in one stroke!Master, since l'm doing so well,may l take it easyfor the next eight to ten days?There is no end to learning.lf you want to become Joint Chief,you will have to keep practicing.Actually, l never really thought aboutbecoming the Joint Chief.But every now and then,l would do some good deeds.lf l had known,l would have let those bad men take you.Because of you,l don't even know where l am now.Master will be so upset with me.There were two things in this worldthat l was most scared of.One was thunder and lightning.And the other...Little lamb,now is your chance to repay me.l'm leaving now. You take care.Help! Help!Help! Master, help!Help! Help!Uncle Pai Yun, help!Oh no, a dead end.Help, help...l don't want to die...Help!Master, help me...Master, help me!l never really believed in miracles.But at that moment, l really wantedto fly up to the sky to thank her,to take a closer look at her face.But unfortunately, l was too tired.When l met him, he was justan ordinary military officer.Who would have guessed he wasto become General Wu San Kuei,who guarded Shanhaikwan and helpedto rewrite the history of Chung Yuan.You were lucky l found youin the woods this time.Next time you may not be so lucky.l alone am sober among the drunks.Cheers!Come again. Bottoms up.l enjoyed being with himbecause l got to do allthat was forbidden by my master.Come on.Yi Hang.Fear not the criticisms of others, aslong as you are at peace with yourself.What kind of a life would it beif you always haveto look to others for approval?You're better off dead.l've said so much.Did you hear any of it?l didn't think a ferocious man like himcould have such a kind heart.Sometimes l wondered if he was kindto me only because l was an orphan.Cho Yi Hang!You stole a sheep fromfarmer Ho Tor Niu's home.Do you plead guilty?He not only stole my sheep,he gave me a bloody nose too! Look!l was only trying to savethe sheep from being butchered.Master, you saidwe should be chivalrous,but they wouldn't even leta little sheep live.Do you plead guiltyto injuring Ho Tor Niu?He called me a beast and a bastard!He was luckyl didn't feed him dog shit!What's so funny?Chief, as the eldest student of Wu Tangand successor to Joint Chief,what Cho Yi Hang did was a disgrace tothe clan and to Wu Tang's reputation.Actually, Uncle Pai Yunwas not really that bad.He was just overly ambitious.He wanted to defy tradition and havehis daughter succeed as Joint Chief.As such, l became an eyesore to him.Calligraphy, like swordplay,calls for stamina.This is my fellow student,Brother Lu Hsin Cheng.For all clans, stamina comesfrom the brush and strength.With spirit comes energy.With spirit comes energy.Energy moves the brush.Energy moves the brush.Waist more erect than brush.Waist more erect than brush.Wrist up!Wrist up!Arm like a dancing dragon.Arm like a dancing dragon.Sister Lu Hua is late!Sorry, Dad.Sit down.Begin practicing calligraphy.Cho Yi Hang, your punishmentis to copy 500 times.l knew it.Succumb not by poverty...This is fellow student,Sister Ho Lu Hua.Did you notice she often smiled at me?She frequently brought foodto cheer me up....lt means not becoming indulgentand losing your true selfwhen given wealth and power.Yield not to prowess.lt means not submittingto powerful influences.Understand?Cho Yi Hang, don't thinkyou can do whatever you wantjust because the Chief is fond of you.Look at your fellow students.They missed dinner to practice writing.And you're eating buns here?Follow Lu Hua's example:pure as a virgin, crafty as a rabbit.You're lazy and nonchalant!l know Sister Lu Hua isbright and ingeniousand the brothers are budswaiting to bloom and flourish.You, the eldest student, should serveas an example to your brothers,but instead you fool around duringlessons. Do you admit you're wrong?Also, you left without permission andcruelly killed Kaifeng's Constable Fang.Do you plead guilty?No.Uncle Pai Yun, l stabbed him only once.l wouldn't call that """"cruel"""".How can he talk this way?How can he call himselfa student of Wu Tang?That's against propriety.l disagree, l feel that's not a problem.So you're admitting guilt?l admit l killedthe lowlife officer, but...With rock solid proof,you still try to argue?l have nothing more to say,but the lowlife officer's family has.Everyone. Please do notmisunderstand Swordsman Cho.My son was to blameand he deserved to die.Yes. We were lucky Swordsman Chocame to the rescue.Otherwise,the bastard would have raped me!He was going to kill my children too!Thank you so much for saving our entirefamily, Swordsman Cho. Thank you.Get up! Get up please!Silence in the palace!Thank you.Pai Yun, what wrong didmy unruly pupil do nowto have to trouble the presenceof the Eight Clans' elders?He used his position ofthe favorite pupil of the Chiefto do whatever he pleases and bulliesthe students of the other clans.With our witnesses here,he can no longer deny it!Yi Hang, what do youhave to say for yourself?Chief, these are the studentsof the Six Big Clans.lf l alone can beat them all,it means Wu Tang's training and fightingstyle is stronger and more powerful!ln that case, l plead guilty!Quiet!Brother Cho put it beautifully.Quiet!Ma Yu of Kung Tung Clan,were you injured by Cho Yi Hang.No. l just hurt myself in training.And you, Liu Cheng of Tien Chuang Clan?How were you hurt?Oh, l hurt myself while playing.What do the others have to say?l fell into the wellwhile trying to get water.l was chased by a tiger.We were only joking.You all leave now. Nonsense!You!l hit him because he went toWan Chun brothel and wouldn't pay.You!You conspired with some officialsand tried to take over a peasant's farm.And you...Just because you fight well, doesn'tmean you can harass the scholars.Cho Yi Hang!Yes.You went awaywithout Master's permission.You will be punished.Face the Buddha in the palacewithout a drop of water for three daysto think over your faults.Yes.You are always looking so stern.Why don't you take a break?You must be ecstatic to see me.Are you hungry?Here's something to eat.Thank you.You call that real food?Look at the good stuff l brought.Come on.Cho...Brother Cho,we didn't mean to put you on the spot.Master Pai Yun made us do it.Yes...You're not going tohold a grudge, are you?Of course not. lt's already forgotten.Thank you.You, don't forget to payat the brothel next time.Brother,try this red kaoliang wine from Shansi.Good.You can just forget it.Can't you seeBrother Cho is still holdingthose two snow white bunsSister Lu Hua gave him?Hey, do you all knowthis is the palace of Wu Tang?Wine and meat, are you trying to getBrother Cho into more trouble? Get out!Get out of here!What about me?Yes, you too.l'll go back to sleepso you can sleep with Brother Cho!What are you doing?This jade heirloom is from my dad.Now l'm giving it to you. But you'llhave to promise not to break it.Don't go!What do you want?l have to go take a leak.You stay here and cover for me.Cho!You're right. Now is the timeto serve the country.Kill the rascalsand remove all evil spirits!Yes!Cho!Stealing military food suppliesis a serious crime.You may be beheaded.Rather be beheadedthan to starve to death.Come over here.There's something to eat.Don't fight! Everybody will get some.You're with child, be careful.Let me get it.Come on.Little sister, hurry up and eat.How dare you beggars steal the RoyalChing Palace military food supply!Kill them all!Honey, let's get going.Honey, are you alright?lt hurts.l haven't tasted foreign womenin a long time!Honey, come on out! Quick!Pretend we're dead.Kill all these foreign beggars!l'll kill you, you witch!l'll chop you into nine pieces!Exactly nine pieces!Run, the witch is powerful!Hurry up, run!Honey, just hang in there!Oh! l'm really hurting!Darling, just hang on!l can't!

        And the Presley family,thank you guys.Lisa Marie, Priscilla,I love you forever.Two daysafter this glorious night,Lisa Marie Presley was dead.Her death at 54 was the lastin a string of tragediesthat echoed through her life.The cause has notyet been determined,but we have informationthat may explain...why her heart suddenlystopped beating.Lisa hadlost 40 to 50 pounds in just six weeks.We're also told shewas back on opioids.



Lisa survivedalmost impossible odds,with tragedy heaped on tragedy.The level of trauma,loss and griefthat this womanhas had to deal within her lifetime is catastrophic.Lisa wasdogged by failed marriages,a brutal custodyfight and financial ruin.There are ongoingcustody issues, family strife,and tens of millionsof dollars on the line,and we have inside informationabout how thiswill all play out.On the day she died,Lisa's estate wassuddenly flush with cash.It's a story ofhistory repeating itself.



TMZ investigatesUnending Tragedy.It's Thursday, January 12th.A 9-1-1 operatorreceives a frantic callfrom a housekeeper,a housekeeper atLisa Marie Presley'srented Calabasas mansion.The housekeeper has found Lisalying unconscious in her bedroom.Lisa's ex-husband, DannyKeough, is living with herand has just returned home fromdropping her twins off at school.The housekeeperhands Danny the phone.Paramedics trieddesperately to save her.She's not breathing,and it's unclearhow long she'sbeen without oxygen.They give her a shotto restart her pulseand she's immediatelytaken to a nearby hospitalwhere she's put on life support.But doctors quicklydetermined it's hopeless.At that point, we knewthat it was extremely dire.What I was told last nightfrom a family member,they are saying theydon't know how longLisa Marie was withouta heartbeat or a pulseand obviously that has an impactbecause it was the housekeeperwho eventually came in- and found her.- Found her.Her mother, Priscilla,rushes to be by her side,and Lisa's eldest daughter,Riley, she's on a plane,she's desperately trying toget back to see her mother,but it was not meant to be.Doctors informed the family,Lisa Marie is brain dead.The family signs a donot resuscitate order,and Lisa suffers asecond cardiac arrest.She's pronounced dead at 54.Thursday late inthe... in the afternoon,early evening,around six o'clock,Priscilla actually announcedthat Lisa Marie had passed away.The coroner performs an autopsy:cause of death undeterminedpending toxicology results.But we have informationthat could be highly relevantin determining whyLisa Marie Presley died.Just two days before shedied, Lisa had a lot to celebrate.The film Elvis was nominatedfor three Golden Global Awards.Hey, Lisa, how are you?I just... I just pho... what,did I photo bomb you?No, no, it's perfect.What was it likewatching Austin on stageand during this movie andthe making of this movie?It was mind-blowing.Truly mind-blowing.I really didn't know what...What to do with myselfafter... after I saw it.Austin Butler, whoplayed her father, won Best Actor.And the Presleyfamily, thank you guys.Thank you foropening your hearts,your... your memories,your home to me.Lisa Marie, Priscilla,I love you forever.But Lisa seemed off that night.She was unsteady and gaunt.And have you gotten toknow Austin Butler a little bit?- Yeah. I... I'm gonna grab your arm.- Yes.Um, a lot, a lot,actually. I adore him.I invited her up to theplatform, which has two stepsto come up, and I said,""Here, come on up.""And I reached out my handto help her, and it was clearthat she was, you know,not coming up the two flights.I went down and... andmet her on the carpet itself.And definitely, whenthe interview was over,I, you know, I turned tomy producer next to meand said, ""Something's...Something's off here.""She was slurring her speech.She had drooping eyelids.She was unsteady on her feetand actually had to holdonto somebody to stand up.Not normal for a woman whois otherwise healthy at her age.The behavior at theGolden Globe was consistentwith somebody on alot of substance and...And to my eye,pharmaceutical medication.Now, here's what weknow: family sources tell usLisa desperately wanted tolook her best for award season.So two months before theGlobes, she had plastic surgery,and she also began takingvery powerful weightloss medication.Family sources also tell usLisa had lost 40 to 50pounds in just six weeks.We're also told shewas back on opioids,something she hadstruggled with for years.I've come a long way. I havea therapist, and she was like,""You're a miracle.You really are.""She's like, ""I don't knowhow you're still alive.""I'm not perfect. My fatherwasn't perfect. No one's perfect.Our sources say, just beforeLisa went into cardiac arrest,she complained of abdominal painthat got worse and worseas the morning wore on.As for what caused that painand the cardiacarrest that followed,well, toxicology resultscould be revealing.Whatever the autopsy reveals,Lisa's death was eerily similarto what happenedto her dad in 1977.Elvis Presley diedtoday. He was 42.Apparently, itwas a heart attack.He was found at his homein Memphis, not breathing.His road manager triedto revive him, but he failed.A hospital tried torevive him. It failed.His doctor pronounced himdead at three o'clock this afternoon.As we know, Elvis also struggledwith severe drug addiction.And, yes, he also died aftersuffering a cardiac arrest at 42.So it was 1977, andLisa was just nine at the time.She was staying at Gracelandwhen she heard all of this commotioncoming from herfather's bathroom.She was quickly usheredaway as friends and stafferstried desperately tosave her father's life.I will never forget that, upstairs up inElvis's bathroom where we found him.I was there with him,trying to revive himand I looked at the front... at the door,and standing by the doorway was Lisa.The undisputed King ofRock 'n' Roll, Elvis Presley, is dead.He died this afternoon here inhis adopted hometown of Memphisafter apparently collapsing inhis South Memphis mansion.And the mayor has ordered all flagsof the city to be flown at half-staff.She's nine years old,and to not justlose your father,but to, sort of, have itdone in this chaotic fashionwith people runningaround, upset,waiting to findout what happens,that's the kind of thing I thinkwould leave a lingering trauma.Pandemonium has broken outhere on Elvis PresleyBoulevard in Memphis.Thousands of fans from all over thecountry are converging on Graceland,trying to get in to view the body ofthe 42-year-old King of Rock 'n' Roll.Priscilla Presley, whowas then a Scientologist,brings her daughter, Lisa, to theScientology Center for grief counseling.Her counselor,Karen de la Carriere,says the little girl wasseverely traumatized.Lisa was traumatizedbeyond belief.You know, youcan't un-ring the bell.You can't not see astuck picture in the mind.I believe she had this memoryin the deep freeze in hermind that she couldn't...It wasn't just the picture,it was the emotions,the mood, thefeelings at that moment.When I seepictures of you from...From when you were growingup, you don't look very happy.Why?I don't know. I wassort of a, that's...you know, um,per... I... I don't know.I... I was very deep as a kid.I had a lot ofquestions about life.Exposed to death very early.Her mother, Priscilla,would drop off LisaMarie every day.This big blacklimousine would pull up,and Lisa, with along face, miserable,would step out of the limousine.And I heard Priscillasay, ""Handle her!""The death of her dadwould be enough tragedyto last a lifetime, but itwas just the beginningof decades filledwith heartache.Four divorces,years of substance abuse,deep in debt, and a verypublic ugly custody fight.And, of course, two otherprofound losses in her life:the death of her ex-husband,Michael Jackson, of a drug overdose,and the suicide ofher son, Benjamin.The level of trauma,loss and griefthat this womanhas had to deal within her lifetime is catastrophic.It's the kind of thing thatyou never fully get over.You can have a lot oftherapy to help you deal with it,but to have that kind oftrauma is life-changing.By all rights, Lisa could haveretreated forever after her son's suicide,but she slowly came out of her shellwhen Elvis was released last summer.And she spoke at a Gracelandevent earlier this year,honoring what would'vebeen her father's 88th birthday.You're the only people thatcan bring me out of my house.I'm not kidding.Lisa's reemergencewas a testament to her resilience.Resilience that wastested over and overby death, drugs, and divorce.She admits to having aterrible cocaine problem,admits to mixing alcoholwith pills, including opioids.The fact that she gets up and goesto the Golden Globes, good for her.I wish somebody had raised the alarm,though, based on how she was looking.Lisa Marie Presley waslaid to rest at Gracelandjust over a week ago, nextto her beloved son, Benjamin,and steps away from her father.In some ways,she came full circle.I mean, she spent the first nineyears of her life at Graceland.On February 1st, 1968,Priscilla gave birthto Elvis's only child,Lisa Marie Presley.This room showshow much Elvis liked Hawaii.The... And it's said Lisa Mariewould take naps as a childin this chair in the corner.The birth of theKing's only childon February 1st, 1968, is huge.Fans are just obsessed,and so is Elvis.My little daughter goes aroundand says, ""Elvis, what you gonna do?""Swear to God. ""Elvis?""I said, ""Honey, I'm your daddy.Don't call me..."" ""Okay, Elvis.""Elvis spoils her rotten.He buys her furs, jewelry,and even nameshis plane after her.Priscilla writes in her memoirthat Elvis justlavished gifts on her,and she put it in avery interesting way.She said that hegave her everythinga child shouldn't haveand couldn't appreciate.He was very protective,very adoring, and very watchful.And, you know, Iknew that... that...I knew that I was loved, therewas no question about that.- Were you very close to your father?- Yes.- It was a daddy-daughter kind of thing?- Yeah, very Much.What was he like as a father?Very, um, you know, adoring.Very sweet. I knew thathe was crazy about me.At Graceland,young Lisa has the run of the place,and everyone there knows it.No one dares messwith the King's princess.I knew that no one was gonna tell mewhat to do because they would get fired.I was truthfully aterror, to be honest.One of the cooks justrecently told me, she said,""You came in the kitchen oneday and you said, 'I want... I want it.'""She'd made a chocolate cakeand she said... and I wanted to eat it.She said, ""You can't rightnow. Your father said, no,you're gonna havedinner,"" and I said,""You're fired. Getout. This is my house.""When she would be atGraceland and go down to the frontto see the fans thatwere gathered there,they'd ask her for an autograph,and she'd sign her nameand write some rudemessage as well.Or she said how people would say,they'd give her a camera and say,""Can you go up and take a picture of yourfather?"" And she'd say, ""I'll do that.""And then she'd just throw thecamera away and not come back.Elvis and Priscilladivorce when Lisa's just five.And then after, shebegins splitting her timebetween Graceland andPriscilla's new home in Los Angeles.She's very spoiled and indulgedwhen she's visiting her father.And then when she's backwith her mother, Priscilla triesto restore some kind ofdiscipline, and it wasn't easy.The... the teenageyears can be difficult,but for Lisa, it washarder than most.After her father's death, Lisamoves in with Priscilla full-time,and that's when thingsbetween the two of themstart to get really tense.I really gave it tomy mom pretty badly, I felt.When I was younger, it was,like, difficult to have a relationship.Lisa wanted to dowhatever she wanted, whenshe wanted, how she wanted,and her motherwanted to contain that.And that was Priscilla's agendafor having her come week afterweek into Scientology therapy.When Lisahits her teenage years,she starts using alcoholand drugs, including cocaine.This is a problem that getsworse and worse over the years.She woke up a differentperson at 13 years old,of which I never expected.And it does happen, and Iwasn't quite prepared for it.She did dabble in drugs.I was a lost soul for a while.I didn't know what I was doing.I had no purpose in my life.I didn't know what Iwanted to do with myself,and, you know, finding myself...When Lisa is 17,Priscilla is at her wit's end.She kicks her out of the house anddrops her off at the Scientology Center.She hopes the churchcan get a handle on her.Lisa stays therefor eight months.She basically threw meout in the middle of the night.You know, onenight, I'm... ""Get out!""She drove me to the church onenight and sort of dumped me off to them.It was like 2:00 in themorning, and I was in hysterics.Lisa falls in love withanother member of the church,a musician named Danny Keough.I knew, at 20 yearsold, actually earlier,that Danny was the man Iwas having my children with.And I don't knowhow I knew that,I just knew he was theone, he was the right one.And he was gonna be the personthat I would be okayto be connected tofor the rest of my life, regardlessof what happens with us.It was like this propheticthing I knew at, you know, 19.They marry andhave two kids together,Riley and Benjamin.They divorce after six years.Danny will resurfacein a big way years later.Just three weeks afterthe ink dries on the divorcepapers, Lisa marries again.Marries an iconas big as her dad.A marriage that will playout bizarrely in public.I didn't speak with herwhen I did get pregnant,and Michael andI did get married.I think maybe she was upsetbecause I sabotagedsomething when I didn't.And it was nevermy intention to.All day long, worldnews organizations,tabloids and fans,like you see here,have been staring at TrumpTower just looking at it,wondering if this incrediblestory could be true.A great acknowledgement...26-year-old Lisa Marie Presley,mother of two and thedaughter of Elvis Presley...The King of Rock'n' Roll... married?To Michael Jackson, theproclaimed King of Pop?- Michael Jackson?- God!- Michael Jackson?- I thought we weren't gonna go here.Why did you marryMichael Jackson?It's the most shockingmarriage, maybe ever.The daughter of the King of Rocktying the knot with the King of Pop.- You do?- Yes, she put.- You put it on her first, okay?- Okay.When you put it, you'll say,""With this ring, I do wed.""- With this ring, I do wed.- Right.So, at first they triedto keep it under wraps, but then,in 1994, they go publicat the MTV Music Awardswith that infamouscringe-worthy kiss.Nobody thought this would last.His hand was blueafter we got off that stage.Completely blue. I squeezed itso hard. I did not wanna do that.You know, it was just,it's not in my natureto do that sort of thing, so.But I understoodit, as his wife I had...You know, I needed todo some things like that.Lots of people thought that kiss wasa smoking gun: the marriage was fake.But we've spoken withpeople in the middle of it all,and they say their lovewas as real as it gets.I think there wasa genuine affectionbetween Michael andLisa, from what I saw.It all starts in 1993, whena lawyer who has tieswith both Michael andLisa hooks them up.So, I remember once Lisaasked me about Michael Jackson.And, interestingly,a couple days later,I was talking with Michaelon the phone and he said,""Do you ever talk toLisa Marie Presley?""So, a light bulbwent on; I said,""Okay, Lisa'sasking about Michael.Michael's asking about Lisa.Seems like it might be timefor them to get together.""And they got together and,as they say, the rest is history.Michael! Hey! Mike!On somelevel, it all kind of makes sense.Two very famous peoplewho had both grown upin the white-hotspotlight finding love.And as the daughter of Elvis,she knew a little somethingabout living with aneccentric creative genius.Obviously, Michael and Elvisare the two biggest solo artistsin the history of ourbusiness and our culture.So it made sense to methat he and Lisa wouldfind a common interest.But their marriagebecomes the constant butt of jokes.I'll take first prize formarrying this freak.Cut it out!I'm telling you, I'mtelling you, I ain't finished.I'm telling you, I mean,his whole family is freaky.Some people thinkthe marriage was just a stunton Lisa's part tojumpstart her music career.For Michael, some thinkit was an effort by himto take the focus away from the childmolestation charges that he was facing.And some people think it wasjust a play on Michael's partto get Elvis's music catalog.So what do youthink about Michael Jacksonand Lisa Marie PresleyJackson as a match?It's all a cover-up.It's all a cover-up fromthe little child thing.That's what I think itis, and that's about it.- You don't think it's true love?- No. No.You thinkthis is a real marriage?- Yes.- No.They try to putthe rumors to restin a bombshell interviewwith Diane Sawyer.60 million people tune in.As you know, thereaction to this marriage...And I know youfeel strongly about it.But the reaction to this marriagehas been across the spectrum,everything from astonishment,to delight, to suspicion,that it was somehow...too convenient.Lisa did... did you askMichael about the charges?Did the two of youtalk about the impactof the marriageon the allegations?Absolutely not. He called...I was in touch with himthrough the whole processof his charges going on.I was talking to himwhen he disappeared.I was actually supposed togo to San Juan, Puerto Rico,when he left and disappeared,and I got a call that hewasn't gonna be there.And I was actually partof the whole thing with himby talking to him onthe phone, so I didn't...Did you sayto him, ""Are they true?""No, I didn't. No,I actually did not.I've heard thatit's a Scientology plan.You were a member ofthe Church of Scientology,which is said to influenceits members greatly,and that the husband youdivorced was Scientologist,and he's still verymuch in your lifeand this is all partof a calculationto get Michael and hismoney into the church.It's crap. I'm sorry.And it's, like, ridiculous.It's ridiculous. It's the mostridiculous thing I've ever heard.- Are you going sing together?- No.I don't sing. I... I did sing.But that's not whyI married Michael.I don't needthat. That's ridiculous.If I wanted it, I mean, I'mnot gonna marry someonefor a recording career, justto clear that up as well, um...- What?- Stop.And then, of course,the question on everyone's mind.We wanna know ifyou've done the thing.Are you having sex together?Are you guys intimate?- Again...- I can't believe it.- Wow!- This is about the skepticism.Yes. Yes! Yes.And we haveread in the papers thatyou are expecting a child.We will be expecting achild. When, I'm not gonna...We're not gonna say when. It'sup in the hands of the heavens.The marriage startsto unravel, but not because of scandal.We know Michael was desperate to have kidswith Lisa, but she already had two kids.Michael's friend andfuture wife, Debbie Rowe,steps up to the plate andoffers to carry a baby for them,and Lisa doesn'tlike it one bit.I offered to take care of...Of having the baby, or babies,while they were working,so she wouldn'thave to worry aboutputting her career on holdor having to change anything.And I thoughtthat by doing this,she would understandthat it was a gift of love,not trying to ruin a marriageor anything like that,because I would never.And I think maybe she was upsetbecause I sabotagedsomething, when I didn't.And it was nevermy intention to.It got really ugly atthe end. It wasn't pretty.Did he fight yourgetting a divorce?No, he... I think he gotonto, you know, getting...somebody else pregnant, right?Or having a baby.That's what he wanted.He seemed to get on that prettyquick, you know, I don't know.And did it shakeyour confidence?Yeah, I was pretty much...Needed to be mopped upoff the floor after that one.I think...she was hurt because Ithink she misunderstoodmy relationship with Michael.I didn't speak with her...when I did get pregnant,and Michael andI did get married.I think she was so angry with mebecause, in a way,I kind of tooksomething from her.I didn't kindof do it, I did it.I took away something from herthat she just wasn'tready to do at that time.Lisa and Michael divorcedafter two years of marriage,but there would be somuch more heartbreak ahead.More marriages, more divorces,more massive money problems,and another tragic deaththat would send Lisaspiraling out of control.BenjaminKeough took his own life.He was 27 years old.He is the son ofLisa Marie Presley.He was a sourceof strength for her.And when he died, it gutted her.Were it not for the twins,Lisa may have followedon Benjamin's path.They meet ata birthday party in 2000and just two yearslater, Lisa Marie Presleyand Nicolas Cageare husband and wife.This did not last long, though.Nick files for divorceexactly 107 days later.Lisa! Lisa!Lisa says what brought themtogether was that they were both rebels,but that's also whatdrove them apart.You know, we weretwo pirates, basically,and one pirate marriesanother, and they'll sink the ship.They would haveknock-down, drag-out fights.And looking back, Lisa describedthe marriage as a big mistake.Nick claimed things justhappened too quickly.I wish we couldn't haverushed the marriage,and sometimes I regretrushing the divorce.But it... it just seemedlike, you know, it...It wasn't gonna... itwasn't gonna change.A year later, Lisajumpstarts her music career.She releases an album,it goes gold that summer,and then she sets out on tour.Her guitarist isMichael Lockwood,and she falls hard for him.They tie the knot in January,2006, marriage number four.I am the happiestthat I've ever been,and in the most sane, calm,best relationshipI've ever been in.And suddenly she'sup for having babies again.In 2008, they havetwins: Harper and Finley.Lisa MariePresley pregnant with twins!Lisa Marie willbe on double diaper duty this fallwhen she and husband MichaelLockwood will welcome twins.Pregnancy clearlyagrees with Lisa Marie.She is absolutely glowingin these exclusive shots.Lisa's in a lot ofpain after the delivery,so her doctorprescribes her opioids,and that sets off an addictionthat will dog her forthe rest of her life.Back at the time when LisaMarie was giving birth to the twins,doctors were givingout opiates liberally.And there was actuallya movement afootat the time that ifanybody was in any pain,they absolutely should be givenopiates, as much as they needed.In 2009, a yearafter she gives birth,Michael Jackson diesof a drug overdose.TMZ was first to reportthat Michael Jacksonhad died today.She's utterly devastated,which opens the doorto more drug abuse.It is believed he sufferedcardiac arrest in his home.Yourreaction, your first reaction?Real, honest-to-goodnessshock. Not even tears.Just, you know, I wasfloored, honestly floored.Lisa's marriage toMichael Lockwood lasts 10 years.In 2016, she files for divorce.To describe this split as nastyis a gross understatement.They go to war over custody.Lisa claims she foundhundreds of imagesof child porn onLockwood's computer,but two investigations find thatthose allegations were unfounded.Michael also makesaccusations against Lisa,calling her an unfit mother,citing her ongoing drugand alcohol addictions.We've learned Priscilla was soconcerned about Lisa's addictions,she actually sided with MichaelLockwood in their custody war.In 2017, she sitsfor a depositionwhere she admits to havinga terrible cocaine problem,admits to mixing alcoholwith pills, including opioids.She opens up, revealingthat she's been to rehabseveral different times.There were insinuationsbeing made and...And outright allegations thather competency as a motherwas in question because ofher use of prescription drugsand of... of her addiction.And so my message to her wasthat she, you know, she could actuallybe in a stronger position by... bybeing open and being transparentand... and being accountablefor her own health.Lisa's terrified that herhistory of drug abusecould cost her her kids.At the end of the day,the judge gave 60% of thecustodial time to Lisa Marieand 40% to Michael Lockwood.Doesn't mean thatthey don't have issuesor they didn't have issues,but none of us are perfect.And in family court, we're just lookingfor parents that are good enough.Lockwood asks for a whopping$40,000 a month in child support.Our sources tell us they eventuallysettle for six grand a month.So Lisa's still reelingfrom the divorcewhen tragedy strikes again.And even for someone who'sdealt with so many horrible tragedies,this one is just simplytoo much to bear.TMZ reported that Benjamin diedSunday, July 12th inCalabasas, California,from a self-inflictedgunshot wound.On July 12th, 2020,Lisa's 27-year-old son,Benjamin, shoots andkills himself in her home.His girlfriend discovers him.Later, the coroner findscocaine and alcohol in his system.BenjaminKeough took his own life.He was 27 years old.He is the son ofLisa Marie Presley,the grandson of Priscillaand Elvis Presley.Lisa and Benjaminwere extremely close.Family sources tell us theyhad dinner with each otheralmost every single night.He was a sourceof strength for her.And when he died, it gutted her.She describes her pain assuffocating and bottomless.She locks herselfinside her homeand she basically doesn'tcome out for the next two years.Family sources tell us they hadbrutally candid conversations with Lisa.And they say, wereit not for the twins,Lisa may have followedon Benjamin's path.On the two-year anniversaryof Benjamin's death she writes...Multiple family sources tell usLisa went back on opioidsto cope with her grief.People use opiates to manageemotional and physical pain.They keep going becauseof the biology of addiction.They can't stop andcan't stay stoppedbecause of thebiology of addiction.There's a hero in this.Ex-husband Dannyrealizes Lisa is in real danger,so he moves in with her.It's not romantic.He moves in to comfort herand to care for the twinsfor two and a half years,right up until the day she died.As forPriscilla and Lisa, we knowthey barely spoke withone another for years.There was a lot of badblood between them.Yes, they were with eachother at the Golden Globes.Some family members told usthey were absolutely shockedto see them sittingat the same table.A family fracturedand grief-stricken,and unfinished business.Who will getcustody of the twins,and who will inherit what?On the money front,we know Lisa's deathturned out to be ahuge reversal of fortune.She basically blew through$100 million in 25 years.But we found outon the day she died,Lisa's estate wassuddenly flush with cash.Good morning and welcometo Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee.Despite inheritinga vast fortunefrom her father when she was 25,Lisa Marie was deeplyin debt when she died.Priscilla grewthe Elvis estate by makingsome pretty savvybusiness decisions.She turned Gracelandinto a tourist mecca.What Priscilla opened uphere today is a gold mine.She could havehad a big garage salelike Bing Crosby'swidow did recently.But the fans still would'vecome here, so why not cash in?I mean, my mother tookit and turned it around.It was nothing, you know?It wasn't gonna provide for meor keep everybodyafloat or do anything,so she had to do what sheneeded to do, and I understand that.And Lisa got a nicecut: $100 million.That should have lastedher a lifetime. It didn't.Lisa was neverdisciplined about money.She was a big spender, andshe made some bad investments.She basically blew through$100 million in 25 years.We've learned at thetime of Lisa's deathshe was $4 million in debt,including 2.5 millionstill owed to the IRS.But we found outon the day she died,Lisa's estate wassuddenly flush with cash.Family sources tell us Lisa a hadtaken out life insurance policies...One for $25 million,another for $10 million.And there may have beena third $10-million policy,but they're notsure if it lapsed.Bottom line... there'smore than $30 millionto be dividedamong the three kids.So it appears,financially, at least,Riley, Harper and Finleyare going to be just fine.But there arestill big questions.Who gets custody of the twins?Who will still beable to see them?With so much badblood in the family,that could get very complicated.Lisa's twins,Harper and Finley, are only 14.They need a parent, andthere are several takers,but there is oneodds-on favorite.A judge cannot ordercustody to a non-parentover MichaelLockwood's objection,unless the judge findsthat it would be detrimentalto the children to bein Michael's sole care.And that is extraordinarilydifficult to do.So everyone's beenwondering, you know,""Who's gonna getcustody of the twins?""You know, there's a lotof bad blood in this family,but we recently learnedthat Michael Lockwood,who's the father of the girls,is actually gonna get fullcustody at the end of the day,which the girls,apparently, are okay with,and this should allshake out in the end.Based on what we arehearing, it is almost certainMichael will have fullcustody of the twins.He was getting $6,000 a monthfrom Lisa in childsupport, but that ends.So the question now...Could Michael ask to usesome of the life insurancemoney to help support the children?The life insurancemoney will go into a trustand Michael Lockwoodcan go to the personwho's in charge of that trustand request moneyto be distributed from it.He could say, ""Look, I no longerhave child support being paid to me,so I need funds tohelp support these kids.""If the person in charge ofthe trust denies that request,he can always go to the court and petitionfor some funds to be released to him.Turns out thingsmay not be so simple.As we were preparingthis documentary,we found out there is a familyfight brewing over that money.This is a verycomplicated family.We're being toldRiley desperately wantsto maintain a relationshipwith her sisters.Of course, Priscilla wantsto see her granddaughters.And as for Danny, he absolutelywants to stay in touch with the kids.But there may be a problem.The fact is, sinceBenjamin died,Danny was with thetwins more than Michael.There is a lot of bad bloodbetween Danny and Michael.We're told on a ten scale,ten being hate,they are at nine.Right now, we know that Priscillaand Riley are still seeing the twins.As for Danny, his futurewith the girls is unclear.It's really sad; thetwins will now spendthe rest of their liveswithout their mother,but there's plentyto remember her by.I suspect that they willsee her as a loving motherwho struggled withher own demonsand really tried sohard to fight addictionand be there for them,but, ultimately, theylost her too earlyto get to know heras adults themselves.The question now... was Lisa'sdeath at such a young age inevitable?Could it have been prevented?The fact that she gets up and goesto the Golden Globes, good for her.I wish somebody had raised the alarm,though, based on how she was looking.With such along family history of drug abuse,and tragedy after tragedy,was it all simply more thananyone could possibly bear?She herself had so many losses.She lost her sonat a very young age.Her dad, she was very, veryyoung when he passed away.And Michael passedaway and she was young.And it just, you know, I hope...I truly hope that they allfind each other in heaven.It means a lot.I just think...she deserves that.She deserves to see her dad.She deserves to see her son...And Michael, of course.I really...I really, truly... I hopethat they're together.They... they'resupposed to be together.If Lisa does turn out to be thelatest casualty of opioid addiction,it could shine aneven brighter lighton one of the biggestcrises in America.Deep pain is alwayspresent in peoplethat get going on opiates,and we should havedeep compassion for her.She's one of the now,I'm sure, millions of peoplethat have died from thispandemic, the opioid pandemic.And we should have deepcompassion, and we should be angryand we should wannado something about it.""Grief is the pricewe pay for love.""A broken heart wasthe doing of her death.Now she is home whereshe always belonged,but my heart ismissing her love.""Grief is the pricewe pay for love,""and today we talkabout Lisa Marie...Lisa Marie Presleywas rememberedlast week at Gracelandwhere she was laid to rest.Remembered assomeone with a good heartand a resilient spirit.I'm gonna readsomething Riley wrote.""Thank you forshowing me that loveis the only thing thatmatters in this life.I hope you finally knowhow loved you were here.I hope I can love mydaughter the way you loved me.Thank you forgiving me strength,my heart, my empathy,my courage, my sense of humor,my manners, my temper,my wildness, my tenacity.""Lisa Marie was all Memphis.She belonged to us,and we belonged to her.Today, we celebrate her love.We admire her artistry,we embrace her family,and we recognize thestrength and sheer force of willit took for Lisa justto keep on climbing.Lisa's voicewill only be amplified with timeand never besilenced or diminished.She was and will alwaysbe her father's protector,and we will continue to be hers.Priscilla read a poemwritten by one of Lisa's daughtersthat encapsulatedher life called Old Soul.This is a poem, The Old Soul.""In 1968, she entered our world,born tired, fragile, yet strong.She was delicate,but was filled with life.Now she is home whereshe always belonged,but my heart ismissing her love.""So as her bodyfinds rest at Graceland,her spirit will live inthe collective memoryof a city that loved her truly.May God bless you.And for Riley,for Harper and Finley,we march forwardin support of you.All of us are with you.That says it all, andthank you all for being here.Our heart is broken, Lisa.We all love you. Thank you."

        Sincro: wyxchariLet me have it. Give it to me at once.Zondal. Zondal fire!Fire now! Zondal fire!Zondal fire! Fire now!Co-ordinates for area red one: oh-oh-eight-one-nine-threevertical. Eight-five-eight-one-eight-oh lateral. _ controls are set.The records wing- it's gone! It's demolished!We're under attack!Report!Leader Clent, surrender or die!What in the blazes?Surrender now or I willblast your base to fragments.



No, I refuse! You can't destroy us!You do not believe me? Verywell. Must I fire again?We must play for time.The building won't stand muchmore of this bombardment, Sir!Then we must talk. Who am I addressing?My name is Varga. Do you surrender?Now frankly, you gain nothing by destroying us, Varga. We bothhave urgent needs. I will agree to talk... but nothing more.No treachery? If I come in peacethere must be trust between us.Very well. There will beno traps, or conditions.See that you keep tothat, for if you lie...What does he want?Our guards won't stand a chanceagainst weapons like that, Sir.Ah, you heard what he said- no treachery, only trust.But can we trust him?



I'm afraid we have to. He's got the best argument on his side- that gun, or whatever it is.We can bluff him though.How?He doesn't know the computer's command to wait. We canthreaten to destroy the glacier, and his ship with it.Yes, yes. Yes possibly.Well why can't we do it, Sir?It's our only chance for survival!Because you know the computers decision- and its reasons.I know all about that! But it doesn'texactly give much thought to us, does it?The computer thinks of everything,considers all the facts.And it's supposed to come up with all the answers, isn't it? Well a fat lot of good it's doing us now! Wait,it says, wait! With glaciers on the one hand, and, and warriors on the other! Well what price your computer now!Walters!What we need, is, is someone like, like Penley, or that Doctor! Someone who can think! Not with a machine! And whatgood's your precious computer done anyway? Nothing! Nothing but trouble! And it's time somebody put a stop to it!That's Varga's voice.We are going in now.We must escape.It's not just a question of escape, Victoria. We've got to take some action.Right, this gun that's given Varga control of the base, without it he'd be helpless.What can we do?Well now, gentlemen, you, you said no traps. And we forour part, have made utterly sure, that there are no traps...I made no promises. I merelywarned you not to trick me.How can we help you?I will tell you what I wantand you will give it to me.Oh, come now Varga, that's not the way to talk. We're, both of us, in a very difficult situation. Undertimes like this it beholds us both to proceed with mutual respect and, because the whole world could be...So much for your word.That was, that was not planned.I have one major requirement: the mercury isotopesfor my ships reactor. You will give them to me.But we don't use mercury isotopes.The Doctor statedthat you had them here.Well he was wrong, we have none.You are lying.What good will it do me?Tell me what will happen if we halted your reactorin order to remove the fuel elements we need.You can't do that!Why?That reactor gives uslight, heat and power.And it powers the ioniser.So that without it, youwould be completely helpless.In Arctic conditions likethese... we'd soon perish.Where as we would not.You'd be wasting your time. Thisreactor does not use mercury.I do not believe you.But you must.There is only one way to find out. Whereare the reactor controls? Tell me now.Did you hear that? Makingthem shut down the reactor!Yes. Now this is Varga's main weapon. There'sjust a chance that I can turn it against him.What?If I can open these doors...there we are! Come on.Now careful. Just stay there.How does this gun operate?Oh, hurry Doctor, hurry.You've got to believe me!So you say.Listen, Varga, the power source is locked in directly with the ioniser. Now if we cut thepower before it is safe, the feedback effect could blast this building into a state of ion flux.What's its temperature range?It can melt rock!Don't interfere withit! It's fully primed.It can melt rock. What a weapon.It is not a weapon. It isa scientific instrument.I see it differently.It's still a highly dangerous machine.Then run is carefully down tosafety level. But no tricks.You do it now.It will take some time.Doesn't matter. Youdare not use it anyway.What?Your Doctor friend talked. I know your fear of myspaceship. That it will explode if the heat is too great.Would it?Close it down. Or you die.She's the only person qualifiedto disconnect the ioniser safely.What are you qualificationsfor existence?I'm the leader here!You have less value to me than yourcolleague, who has certain skills.But she doesn't know everything. Ihave the answers that you require.I know all I need to know. If I killedyou, it would be no great loss to me.No! Please!Then you will do as I say. Run down the machine asquickly as is safely possible. No more tricks. At once.Ah, ah.What is it you're trying to do?Well it's a little difficult to explain,Victoria. Oh. Oh dear. Hold this for me, will you?Ah. This gun works on the basis that sound wavesproduce reverberations in the objects in their path.The objects vibrate in sympathy.Well I know, my father told me once.Yes, that's right. Well if you can produceunsympathetic vibrations, damage results.Damage? Oh, like asinger breaking glass.Yes. But I want to be able to get at the warriors without it affectingthe scientists too much. Now, if we change this to frequency seven...What will that do?Well primarily it affects fluids.What good is that to us?Well I believe that Varga and his warriors have afar greater fluid content than human-beings. There.If it works, what happens?That's just it, I don't know.Oh now look, Doctor.But I do know that whatever effect it has on thescientists, it'll have a far greater one on the warriors.Well how's that?Well apart from the fluid question, theirhelmets will trap and intensify the sound waves.You mean, it'll knock them out and leavethe scientists a bit dizzy? Well is that it?Well that's what I'm hoping, but, there is just a vaguerisk that it'll kill everybody. Clent and Penley included.And Jamie?It's done.It is safe now?Yes. Just ticking over. Not evenholding the ice in check at all.Disconnect it completely, now.Now we must move quickly, before theglacial surge does too much damage.You'll regret this, Varga.At least I will live to regret it.Now, the reactor. Shut it down, quickly.Perfectly at home in ice age conditions.Well, we'll soon change all that.Shut it down at once.Ooh.The heat. What is happening? There is something wrong.You are trying to trick me again. For that you will die!No no! It's too dangerous!It's a risk we must take, Victoria!Oh!Now, cross your fingers. Here we go.Varga, this is the Doctor. Are you going to retreat, or shall I fire again? Trouble is I dare not use it again,if it hasn't killed them all already, another firing most certainly will! Varga! Answer me or I fire again!You will die for this.What are you doing now?Get well back, Victoria.What?Stand by for fireworks! Here we go.Now quickly! Let's get outof here before they come back!The gun is useless.Victoria, see if you can find Jamie.Doctor, Jamie's in there. He's alive!Well thanks heavens for that! Now you getback to the TARDIS, and close the doors!Sorry about that.Oh.Up you get. Come along. Ah.What happened? Did you do that?No time for questions. Come along.So, you allowed them to trick you.I await your punishment, Commander.We have no time. Everything depends on being ready tobreak free from the ice as soon as they evaporate it.Up you get. Come alongMiss Garrett. There you are.Clent. The Doctor did something, butdon't ask me what it was. Are you alright?Oh, the ioniser! Theymade me... disconnect it!Then it must be switchedon again immediately!I don't take orders from you!Miss Garrett, if we are to obey ComputerControl, it must be reconnected. Do so please.Yes, of course.Clent! Their spacecraft ispowered by an ion reactor.Well that means we dare not use the ioniserat full force. That's our last chance gone.Why, for heavens sake?Because of the risk, man!You know what would happen.Of course there's a risk, but it's arisk we must take! It's the only way!Exactly!The computer says no!The computer...Is our supreme advisor.And what sort of adviceis that? Do nothing?We must obey!And be destroyed? Has thecomputer considered that?The computer considers everything.But that's why in this case youcannot rely on its judgement!We trust the computer! It isour strength and our guide.Not this time!Well why not?Because Jamie, the computer is faced with an insoluble problem. Eitherway it risks destroying itself and this it cannot do. It must play safe.Aye, but if it doesnothing that's just as bad.I'll explain to you another time, Jamie.There's only one way out.What?We must override the computer.You can't do that!We must. This is a decision for a man to take, not a machine. The computer isn'tdesigned to take risks, but that is the essence of mans procrease. We must decide.But if you do that soon ruin the world plan! All the ioniser bases must act together!Through World Computer Control! If we act too soon it's as bad as being too late!Yes I know that, but the other bases haven't got a glacier right on top of them, and apartfrom that, what about these ice warriors? If they live, they threaten our entire civilisation.A decision must be taken, and quickly!I can't.I daren't.Penley, it's up to you.Well Clent?I reserve the right toconsult the computer.Go ahead.Problem: alien spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor.Dare we use the ioniser? What are the alternatives? Answer.It's as though it's gone mad!Well Penley?We will use the ioniser at full strength to turn backthe glacier. Miss, Miss Garrett, inform World Control.Er, but the spaceship, ifyou release it from the ice?At full strength theioniser will melt rock!Commander, the glacier isbreaking up. Soon we will be free.What use is our freedom if we arehelpless? Our engines must still dead.I have not given up yet.Nor I. There must be somelife left in the elements.Commander, power.What? The ice is ourfriend. We still have power.Shall I increase it?Carefully. We must time fulltake-off boost perfectly.And when we are free and inflight, we will be invincible.Instrument readings on the glacier face show asteady rise in temperature. Now near to maximum.Well how will we know?The instruments on the ice face have the highest heat _ resistance known toman. When they cease to function, everything about them will be destroyed.You're wrong! You'rewrong! We'll all be killed!It is a risk I willingly take!It was not power in the engines, Zondal, it was heat, ourgreatest enemy! The heat from the ioniser! The... heeeeeeeeeat...!Only a minor explosion.We're safe!Oh. Goodness me!Set all circuits to automatic, Miss Garrett. And tie in with the World loniser instrumentation.Clent, will you, er, check these readings with me? And you've a report to prepare haven't you?Yes, yes, yes I have. Penley. You are the most insufferably irritatingand infuriating person, I've ever been privileged to work with.Thank you.Can't write a report though, can you? Something I've got to do foryou. Well don't worry it's something that I've been trained to do.Without the computer?No Penley. I've always written myown speeches, and my own reports.Are you going to include...Well where's the Doctor?

Now what's biting you?Some crazy nut dancing a jig.Hey, wait a minute.It can't be. Get below fast, both of you.What's the matter?Move!Come on in, the water's lovely. You don't know what you're missing.Doctor! You'll catch your death.Well what do you know? You're right, it is him.What are we going to do?Yes.This is Anton.Where are you?Ten miles west of Cape Harod. Now listen.



Wait a minute.What are you doing there?What do you think we're doing, fishing?I shouldn't be surprised.Oh yeah. We'll this time we've caught a whale. HE'S here!Well that's physically impossible.It's him all right, there's no shadow of doubt about it.Oh no, you're making a mistake, you must be.Now listen, there are three of us here. We've all had a look.Well if you're that definite I'll contact Giles.No! We'll take care of this ourselves.Listen, Anton, you'll do nothing without Giles' agreement.There isn't time!Make time.If you think I'm going to pass up a chance like this, you're crazy.Well at least wait till I get there.Anton! Anton!Giles, that's just what I said. How could it be him?It's a mistake, it must be.Yes, I know, but he was definite. He's going to kill him.I don't care. Get after them, stop them!But Giles what can I do?Look, I don't care what you do Astrid, but stop them!Oh, there's nothing like a dip to freshen you up.Hey, that's a funny looking boat.It's not a boat, it's a hovercraft.Eh?It's a hovercraft. It floats on the air instead of the sea.Oh, yes, I see. I'm too old for fairy tales.No it's true, Jamie.A terrifying thing. It's like a sea monster.Oh, we'll soon get a closer look, it's coming nearer.Oh yes. Yes. I don't think I like the look of this. Let's go.Why, what's the matter?Come on, run!Yeah, but...Don't argue, run. Come on. Come on!If only we had a gun!But why would they want to harm us?Why indeed? What now?Look Doctor, can't we go back to the TARDIS?No, we'd never make it. There's not much cover here.Perhaps we've landed in a world of mad men.They're human beings, if that's what you mean. Indulging their favourite past time - trying to destroy each other. Time we went, come on.Creag an tuire!Oh, well done.What's that?I know those markings, that's Astrid's runabout. What's she doing here?Interfering. We've got to get to him before she does.What is it, Doctor?Oh, I'm frightened!Over here! Run!I can't! I can't!You must, it's our only chance.Hurry!Come on!A very timely and welcome rescue.Don't speak to me for a moment, please.But what is this thing, Doctor?It's a helicopter, Jamie.Eh?A chopper. You know, a whirly bird.He say's it's a bird!No, no, no. It's a primitive form of flying machine.Well at least we're safe now, aren't we?Depends on what you mean by been safe. They've shot a hole in the fuel tank. We might blow up any minute.Here we go.Wait, you're hurt?It's nothing. We're lucky to be still alive.Jamie, give her a hand.Come along inside.I'm all right.Now let's have a look at it. You're not, and please don't argue. Victoria, bring some warm water will you.Well where's the kitchen?Through the arch. There's a medical kit in the bathroom, through there.Go and fetch it, will you Jamie.Right.Come and sit down.It's nothing. It's just a scratch.We'll see.Oh, yes...Who are you?You mean you don't know?No, why should I?Well you went to such a great deal of trouble to save us.Ah, there we are. Thank you, Jamie.Do you know how to use those things?Oh, don't worry, the Doctor will fix you up just fine.Oh, you're a Doctor?Well not of any medical significance.Doctor of law? Philosophy?Which law? Whose philosophies, eh?I see, you're determined to be mysterious.Am I?Um, Doctor of science?Septic spray.That should be right.A Doctor of divinity then?You'll run out of Doctors in a minute. Now, you haven't told us your name yet.Astrid Ferrier.Ah, Miss Ferrier, this is Victoria and this is Jamie. Now this won't take a minute... just want to clean it off... be as gentle as I can.There we are. Who are these men? Why are they so determined to kill us?Kill you? They hate you.Me? I'm the nicest possible person.Or at least I should say they hate the person that they think you are. Passionately and completely.Can't we tell them they've made a mistake?There wouldn't be time.They seem remarkably dedicated.They are.There.Tell me, Miss Ferrier, do you hate me?Far from it. To me your the most wonderful and marvelous man that's ever dropped out of the skies. Will you do something for me?Anything, anything at all.It will probably cost you you're life!Oh, but it would be worth it.Oh that's... that's comforting anyway. What is it that you want me to do?Let me take you to the man I work for, Giles Kent. He'll explain everything you want to know.I don't think so, Miss Ferrier. No, I'm sorry.Um, can we not just listen, Doctor? There's no harm in that.There's a great deal of harm in it. You don't suppose Miss Ferrier saved our skins for our sakes, do you? Now what is it you want us for?You resemble very closely a man who's determined to be dictator of the world. A man who'll stop at nothing.A dictator? Like Napoleon?Who is he?Salamander!Salamander?I know it's surprising. Let me take you to Giles Kent.Oh you're not going to agree?The back door! Hurry!It's too late!In there!Run for it!Come on! Miss Ferrier, come on!But I... He was framed against the window. I saw him, he was trying to get out!No time now, they'll get away!There they are!Wait! If we can get up in the air above them, we can finish this. Now let's get to that helicopter!The helicopter.It'll blow up!Incredible. Absolutely incredible.I'm not a specimen in a glass bowl, you know?Ah, I'm sorry. Do sit down.Oh, thank you.It's just so astonishing. You are Salamander.Do you see what I mean?But surely you know how alike you are? After all, Salamander is a world figure.Well... well my friends and I, we've been out of touch... with civilisation for a while. We're visitors, so to speak, um. On ice shall we say.I see. Where shall I start?At the beginning please. We've been subjected to a number of attacks because I look like this Salamander of yours.I'm not surprised. I'll show you why. I have a video wire of Salamander, addressing the United Zones Conference on World Food.And meanwhile, over at the United Zones General Assembly, from all over the world delegates are flocking in, eager to hear the latest report from Leader Salamander.The progress, Mr President, of the Sun Conservation establishment at Kanowa, in the Australasian Zone......is I'm delighted to report highly satisfactory.But we cannot yet guarantee good summer holidays for all.However, we have now in orbit the Mark VII Sun Catcher, and already we have been able to concentrate the sun's rays into much needed areas. The great Canadian wheat plains are safe.And now, Mr President: Ukraine - the grain field of the planet - an unfortunate area between Bucava and Kirovograd devastated by the elements two short years ago. What have I got to say to you about that? I can tell you that on both banks of the Dnieper river the corn is ripening in the sun! And ten-thousand robot harvesters are moving down to gather in fifty million tons of flour!There's nothing there to say he's a bad man.I quite agree, Victoria. He seems to be a public benefactor. Quite a speaker too and remarkably handsome, didn't you think so Jamie?He's one of the most popular men on the planet. Many people call him the shopkeeper of the world. The saviour, in fact, some of them.Well what's he saved the world from?Starvation - too many people, too little food.Until Salamander invented his Sun Store. Surely you've heard? You must know?Oh yes, well of course we've heard something.The Sun Store collects the rays from the sun and stores them in concentrated form.Oh, like the ioniser, Doctor?Yes, a rather different principle I think, Jamie.Well never mind how it works! What's it for?Salamander can force-grow three, sometimes four, crops in one summer.Well why do these men want to kill him. I mean, one minute you say he's saving the world, the next...For his own ends! Step by step he's taking control of this planet.You have proof of this?Some, yes. I was once a high official in the World Zone Authority - Deputy Security Leader for North Africa and Europe - but Salamander discredited and ruined me because he realized I was beginning to get suspicious.But you could be making up stories about Salamander! Out of revenge.Yes, I suppose so. Then you can judge for yourself. You remember Michael Assevski - he was Controller of the Eastern European Zone? He was drowned at sea a mile from shore. Hockingham murdered! All of them were seen with Salamander, or a man known as his deputy, shortly before their deaths.All of them were replaced by men known to be in Salamander's power.Known by who?By me, Doctor.Well why don't you tell the authorities, the police or whatever?Because I'm discredited, don't you see? Because Salamander is so popular, and also because the man that took my place, a man named Donald Bruce, has since risen to become overall security chief.Surely there is someone you can take your story to?Ah yes, Helvig believed me. So did Assevski, and they're dead. However, there is one other man, a man named Alexander Denes, but none of them will do anything until it's too late!I'm surprised. Well if Salamander is everything you say he is, then why hasn't he tried to...Dispose of me?Yes.Well he has, but he's afraid. You see, the testimony of a dead man still holds legal weight.Oh, I see. Well, it seems we have a problem on our hands whether to believe Mr Kent or not.Well there is one way that you can find out for yourselves.Oh, how?Impersonate Salamander.Yes I thought that's what we were leading up to.Well I must admit, Doctor, you do look like him.Exactly like him.Yes, there's more to it than that. What about the voice?Well it's nearly the same pitch, only the accent.Only the accent! My dear young lady. Oh dear. Now what was it he said... We still cannot guarantee good summer holidays for all. No. Guarantee... no, no, no... guaran... guarantee. You see, it's very difficult. Hmm, of course I always was interested in phonetics. Holidays... summer... summer. He must have come from Mexico, Quintana Roo or Yucatan or somewhere...That's incredible, Doctor, he was born at Merida, state capital of Yucatan.Yes, there are other very strong influences though. Oh, I could do it in time. But what if I did it, what then?You could walk into Salamander's research station at Kanowa, find out how he's getting control of the separate World Zones, and then bring out absolute proof.Yes. I see.How long did you say it would take you to master Salamander's accent?I didn't. It would take three weeks, perhaps four.Well while we've been talking, the Security Chief I told you about, Donald Bruce, has since cordoned off this entire area. He's coming here himself. Now! I'd say you've got about two minutes, Doctor.But that's out of the question!You know what he'll do as soon as he sees you, a man who resembles Salamander so closely?Oh that's not fair!Will you please listen! You'll be under arrest for impersonation as soon as he sees you. I mean it.But isn't there another way out of this?Only one - be Salamander.But the clothes!Yes, there are some in here. A little less eccentric, but do the best you can.I won't! I can't!Your friends, Doctor, do you want them to suffer? Because they will, you know.No, wait a minute! Why is a man like Bruce coming here?Don't push me, there isn't time.You sent for him, didn't you? You tipped him off!I couldn't miss an opportunity like this, now please come on.Giles, for heaven's sake, what have you done? It's far too risky.Hello Kent. Doing some recruiting are you? A bit young for killers, aren't they?What do you mean?All right, what do you mean by stepping in here like this?Anytime, Kent. I've got the right and you know it. Anytime I like.All right, what do you want?That's better, you're ex-security, you know the way it's got to go. We might as well be nice and civil about it, mightn't we?That bungalow in Cedar District. In your name, right?Why?Do I have to tell you? There's been an awful nasty mess out there. Someone has got himself shot in your living room.And who are you two?Jamie McCrimmon.And?Victoria Waterfield.What's the matter, can't you speak?Don't shout at me.Oh, very good, the outraged public citizen. Do they know who I am?Yes they do.A pity, I like to hear you say it. Now listen to this, all of you. One of your men was murdered in a bungalow rented to you. The remains of two others were found in what was left of a helicopter. You were in that bungalow at the time. And there were three other people with you, two youngsters and a man. Right?Now, there was another man, wasn't there? So we'll deal with that first? Where is he?Why hello Bruce, what are you doing here, huh?

        Sincro: wyxchariHello Bruce, what are you doing here, eh?I was under the impression you were in the Central European Zone, Leader.That's what you were meant to believe.Why?I do not care to be questioned by my own security!Well that's just it. How can I possibly maintain security when you behave like this? I'm at least entitled to know your movements.You have a policeman's mind, Bruce.That may be! Only a few days ago you questioned me about this man and his activities. And we agreed that he was dangerous! Now, I find you in his office.Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way.They're not holding you here?



Holding me?Under some threat or other.No one threatens Salamander!I still think I deserve an explanation, Leader.Yes, of course, you shall have it. But not now. When I return from the Central European Zone.Very well.Now what about the dead man found in your bungalow. He was one of your lot, wasn't he?Yes. Um, he was trying to protect me. The other two wanted to kill me.Now why should they want to do that to a nice young girl like you?Well I...Obviously they thought I was there.You?Yes, Bruce, just like you a lot of people don't like me.Don't get clever with me, Kent! I've a good mind to...



I am prepared to accept his story.Well I'm not!That's interesting, but not important. I accept it! That's all that matters.It's beginning to look as if these people are working for you now. Is that right?You still dare to question me! They have information! I shall get it! I will see you on my return. Now leave me!McCrimmon, you said?Aye.Well you just watch your step, that's all.I never said a word.Must be the way you look, Jamie.You were splendid, Doctor.Thank you.That was a dangerous game to play.It paid off. All right, are you with us?I don't know where you stand, Mr Kent. But you and this Salamander are obviously on opposite sides. That at least is clear. But which side is good? Which side is bad? And why should I interfere?Well you're the only man who can help save the world.But isn't that what Salamander's trying to do?Don't you understand? Salamander...Just a moment. Jamie, you're unusually quiet, what do you think?Well to save the world, aye, well it sounds grand, but... Oh, we couldn't turn our back on a challenge like this Doctor. Well, at least I know you wouldn't.We don't know anything about these people.Astrid saved our lives. She was wounded because of it.Oh but Jamie, you don't think...Look, she was...Look we're right about Salamander! It won't take you long to find out for yourselves.How do you propose we do that?He'll be well guarded for a start.We can hardly steal into his study and go through his papers.That man, Bruce, said that he was in the Central European Zone.It's a long way from Australia.It's only two hours by rocket.You could leave almost at once.Oh, what then?I've had a plan for infiltrating into Salamander's inner circle for some time. Well I could adapt it for your two friends.I can arrange three travel warrants and visas. Everything you need.Just three?Well one for Astrid, one for you and ah...Victoria.Of course.Oh that's very clever of you. How can you do that? I thought you said you had no official position?We have a contact there.He must be a very important person.He is. Denes, Controller of the Zone.Oh, I see. What about me?I think we better have a look at Salamander's research station at Kanowa.Yes. Ah, yes, but from a safe distance of course.What is all this? I'll just give you a couple of minutes. I have a meeting.This is important, Benik!I hope so! Well?Salamander's left you in control of the research station?Yes.Did he go on the rocket for the Central European Zone?Yes.Did you see him go aboard?Hasn't been an accident, has there?Did you see the rocket take off?Do you mean, did I stand there waving my handkerchief? Hardly, I had too much to do.You're not a very funny man, Benik! Not to me. Now answer me! Did you actually see him leave?What is all this?I've just driven straight here from having spoken to Salamander. Not two hundred miles away.That's impossible!I don't lie! Even to someone like you. He was with Giles Kent.But he hates Kent.Exactly.Kent wasn't holding him by force, was he?No, I thought of that. Salamander... was a wee bit odd, I admit. Not quite his usual self, but he was perfectly in control. All he had to do was bat an eyelid and I'd have knocked off everyone in sight.Oh, well I don't understand it.Now Salamander suggested that he was on his way to the Central European Zone. Now you're in radio contact with him. I want you to talk to him, make sure that Kent hasn't got some hold over him that... we don't know about.He instructed me not to bother him until the conference was over.Well, I'm countermanding that instruction!I'm telling you, Bruce, he won't answer! Not till the conference is over. It's too important.How long will it last?How should I know!? They last three hours usually.All right, that'll have to do. Let me have a report as soon as you've spoken to him. Is that clear? Is that clear!?Yes.Yes. I want a direct channel link to Leader Salamander, Ariel TLXKZ. Notify me as soon as he is able to accept transmission. That's all.This is dreadful news, Salamander. I still can't believe it.Terrible, terrible.I don't say it will happen. I say it can happen. Your Zone is in danger, Denes. Here, here and here.We've had no trouble for years in those mountains.You don't imagine I make it up?No, no, of course not.Those volcanoes have been dead since sixteenth century. Fedorin is right to doubt.A volcano is a strange thing, my friend. I tell you the truth. It's like a man in the hot sun, sleeping... still... lifeless. Then boom! He wakes full of energy! I know volcanoes.Isn't there a possibility of a... miscalculation for a few degrees.I'm never wrong. Every one of my predictions has been accurate.Yes. You're record is good. I don't deny that.You are too kind. Now will you listen to me!Leader, the communications...I know! I know! I told you I was not to be disturbed!Yes, Leader.No, wait! No, wait Fariah, ah? You like some refreshment, perhaps?Thank you.No, no, not for me.You're going so soon?I must consult my scientific advisors.You still don't believe me?I believe you sufficiently to want to... have your information checked. Before I alarm my people unnecessarily.Your scientists won't help you. They don't know. They are amateurs.No, Salamander, they are not amateurs. They are very clever men dedicated to their work. But they are men, capable of human error like anybody else.Do what you wish. Captain!Sir!Controller Denes is leaving.Yes, sir.You will soon see that I am right. Oh, you will stay, ah? Have a drink. We have a great deal to talk about, you and I. Fariah, see to him.Are you sure this is the right one?I'm not sure of anything after that rocket. But Astrid said it was the third bench on the south walk of the large gardens. Well here it is, I counted.Here we are.It's all arranged. Salamander is in residence in the President's Palace.What's the card?That'll get you through the front gate. Find the terrace facing west.Good luck Jamie.Yes, keep your wits about you.Right.Hello... Hello! Australasian Zone... how much longer? Look, don't talk to me about sun spots. What? Well, the Central European Zone. Please don't worry about procedure, this is urgent. Connect me!That might be her now. Yes.Hello, Giles? This is me, Astrid.Right lets have it. What's happening?Everything's gone fine so far.Speak up, we can't hear you very well.Oh, it's these spots.Oh, she's having spot trouble.Oh yes.Right, how is the plan working so far?It's gone fine. And the rocket arrived right on time in Hungary. And Jamie's got his entrance pass and has started phase one.Do you think the boy can handle it?Well I hope so. My goodness they're a pretty odd lot though, aren't they?Well actually the Doctor's with me right now.Oh, I am sorry. Oh I know... I'm sure they'll be fine.What news of Denes? We must keep him posted as to what is happening.It's all right, we've contacted and we've arranged to meet.Be careful, he's pretty well known.Oh, don't worry. We've ar... I suggested that we meet under a disused jetty by the river.Disused Yeti?No, no, no. Jetty, jetty! Ah, anything else to tell us?No, if the plan goes through, I'll try and contact you again.Right. Goodbye, good luck.Good luck, Astrid. Jamie and Victoria will look after you.Astrid, are you there? We're... She's gone. And I'm not surprised after that last remark.Well I'm sorry.Why don't you sit down?No!Why not?I have never sat here.Salamander won't mind.I would never sit down here.If you don't like him why do you work for him?He has a way of persuading people.Yes I could imagine that.Brujo!What? If only I knew what he wanted to talk to me about. Would you know?Salamander talks to many people. Some only once.Well I shall know soon enough I suppose. What exactly do you do here?I serve.Yes, but you're obviously not an ordinary servant.No, I'm not.What then?Would you like some more refreshments?No... I'll get it myself.Oh that's good.Is it? I'm very glad to hear that.What?I'm Salamander's food taster.Does he need one?There have been many attempts to poison him.Dangerous job.Um. That's why it's very nice to have help for a change.You mean... You mean you haven't...?No. I didn't have time. Still taste good, nothing bitter?N... No. I... I don't think so.You would know by now, I think.Oh... Oh, you... You had me worried for a moment. But what on earth made you take a job as a food taster?She was hungry. Only thing is, now she has all the food she needs, she has lost her appetite. Give me a drink!You are well protected.Um.Very well protected. Be calm. Sit down, drink your drink.Ah! Gua...Thank you for calling the guard. I was wondering what to do about him.Now don't move for that box! Not if you value your life. Now all of you, back over there! That's it. Not as well protected as you think you are, eh? Now when I say duck... Duck, get down!Look at this! What do you do boys, eh? Read? Sleep? It's a fine thing. Here we have an attempt to destroy me and where are you? It's not so good, boys. It's not so good. I'm watching you. Look after him. Better still get rid of him. What's all this about. Eh?I heard two men talking. They said they'd planted a bomb of some kind in your radio telephone. I tried to warn them at the gates, but they wouldn't pay any attention.So you break in? How you break in?Well I'm here on holiday with a friend. She's very pretty, so the guard didn't see me slip past him.Why didn't you call out and warn me? I nearly used the radio telephone several times.Ah you'd have had me shot, most like.Why do you risk your skin to save me?Well without you the Earth hasn't much of a chance, has it?You like to work for me, eh? You like that?Oh no, you don't have to do that. I mean, you owe me nothing.You're quite right, boy.And I'm on holiday.You won't find what I pay you disappointing.Aye, there's my girlfriend too though.Oh we might be able to find something for her. Eh Fariah?Yes, your chief could use an assistant.See to it. What do you say, eh?Well I'll give it a go. But I'll say this though, your security system's rotten. There'll have to be changes.Oh what a boy, ah? Fariah, see he gets some proper uniform instead of this skirt.And bring him and his girlfriend to see me.Come along then.What an extraordinary young man.I prize loyalty very highly, my friend. And I repay it very generously. Like I do the girl Fariah, eh.Can I... Can I ask you something?What is it?What does ""Brujo"" mean?It's a word we use in Mexico... for sorcerer. Why?Nothing... nothing.You stay for dinner, eh?Here comes Jamie.Everything's fine.Oh good.Careful, you might have been followed.Oh don't worry, they think I've saved his life. Hey, he's offered me a job... To you as well.That's perfect.Well done, Jamie.Well it was nothing. All right at your end?Yes. But it was nothing.Jamie. Jamie!What?Does he look like the Doctor?Aye, it's so uncanny.Careful.What's the matter?What is it?She must have eyes in the back of her head....so he's offered the both of us a job.Oh, good.Who was that?Who?The other girl who was sitting there?Why don't you leave them alone? Do you have to treat everyone as if they're criminals?He had no right to leave the Presidential Palace.He had every right! He came to fetch his girlfriend. Salamander ordered it.I didn't hear Salamander order it.Very well, go and ask him.No? Perhaps you're wise. He would follow me. I am Fariah, how do you do?This is Victoria.Hello.Hello. Jamie tells me you're studying the arts of the kitchen.Aye, she's a great dishwasher.I like eating, and I'm hungry.Then let's see if we can't find you something to do. You can work with me if you like.Thank you.I used to love to do this sort of thing when I was a boy.I'm sorry. It was the safest place I could think of.Oh, it's all right. I'm still fit enough.Thank you for getting me the necessary documents.Have you been successful?So far. Salamander's swallowed it.I thought he would.The boy's very confident. The girl, not so much.See, the point is that I'm near enough to him to pick out something. This was the first time I met Salamander. I must say that you were right about him, Astrid. We must get rid of him. He must be stopped.He will be stopped! I'm returning to Giles Kent. Can you wait till we can take action?Oh, with a bit of luck, yes.Fedorin, can you trust him?Oh, I've been followed. I thought I'd thrown them off.No! There is enough violence as it is. Besides, Salamander mustn't get suspicious. You kill his men and he will begin to think.You understand that strangers are to be picked up. There's been an attempt on Salamander's life. Very well, return to your patrol.It's all right. Fedorin, would he betray you in some way?I'm trying to think of some reason why he should.But these are all lies, Salamander. Lies, I assure you.So you say.What are you going to do? My family... my friends.My dear man. My dear Fedorin. You don't suppose I intend to make your swindling public, eh? This is... this just an insurance, um. Sit down, forget it. I tell you what I'm going to do for you.What?You are going to replace Denes as controller of this Zone. But, don't say anything. I'll know you'll accept.What do you want?I'll tell you. There will be disaster in this Zone. I cannot stop the disaster, but I can come to the aid of this Zone when it's happened.And take over? I see. The Zone would be yours!Oh ours, Fedorin, ours. It's a partnership I'm offering you. Either you have half of everything, or you have nothing.But there's Alexander Denes.Oh yes, the popular, well beloved Denes. What a pity.Pity?Oh didn't I tell you, Denes is going to die. Mysteriously... an assassin... terrible.I can't do that! You can't ask me!I think I can ask you to do anything I want.My predictions are accurate! The entire Eperjes-Tokaj Ranges are in eruption! Fedorin, come and look. It's very pretty. The history of Hungary is about to be rewritten!Salamander.What are you doing here, Bruce?I had a report there was trouble here, an attempt on your life.It was nothing. Come and look.Terrible. Those poor people.Salamander! What have you done?I warned you!You couldn't have known! You've done this somehow yourself!The man is mad! Worse still he is incompetent! I warned this man that this zone was in danger of natural disaster and he did nothing! Issued no cautions to the public. You deliberately allowed your people to suffer and die! You're a traitor!You're a traitor! You contrived this for your own ends.Bruce, I order you to arrest this man.But this is nonsense. Fedorin, you were here. You know this is nonsense.Denes you are too naive. At your trial, Fedorin will be the chief witness against you!

        Sincro: wyxchariHelp! Somebody help me.Ohhh... who did this to you?A man named... Salamander.Salamander?He did it... down there...Down there?Now wait a moment! Are you seriously trying to tell me without a shred of evidence that Salamander is attacking the world with natural disasters?He must be.That's what I believe!But it's beyond belief! How could he possibly...



I'm sure we'll find proof in the Records Room.Maybe. But that's where Salamander is.Ahhh... well we shall have to wait until he comes out, won't we?No no, Salamander's place... Danger...Right. Be careful. I'll get you some water.Really Benik, I'm beginning to wondering why I pay you such a monstrously high salary. Worrying me over trifles. Make your own decision! Is that all?You have to sign these passes for the hovertruck food supply.What, now?Well you always told me they had priority over everything.Oh very well.By the way?Yes?The door to the Record Room is jammed. It was alright when you came out, wasn't it?Oh, yes.



Well it won't open now. May I have your key?Aha. I'm going mad. I left it in there, what a fool. Ha ha ha.It's alright, I'll use the emergency key.Yes, do that will you? Right away. Oh please don't wait for these.That was close.How long was he standing there listening to us?I don't know.D'you think he's on to us?I hope not. But he's done us a good turn in bringing me these. This'll interest you, Bruce.Hmm?How many people you say work in the research centre?Fewer than you'd think. It's fully automated, you know. Six engineers, and six guards on duty at any one time.A dozen, eh? Will you tell me why thirty people are catered for here?The war, h-how bad was the war?War? I didn't understand you.I wish there was something I could do for you.What's he done? What's he done? He's kept us prisoners. Listen, there are others... there are more people down the shaft... Salamander's kept us down there, prisoners, years of it. Promise you'll bring them to the surface. Swear it... You've got to swear it...I swear it.This is Salamander. I want a security escort to come to the interrogation room immediately. I'm releasing two prisoners. They are to be conducted to the main gates and set free. Is that understood? Good. Well I hope that works.So do I.What do you want us to do when we get outside?There are plenty of public phones in the area. Dial double zero one and ask for a man named Forrester.Eh?He's my deputy to this area.Double zero one Forrester.Tell him where I am and just say ""redhead"".Redhead.Redhead. Is that clear?Redhead? Is that your wife?It's our emergency call.Sorry.Salamander... Is the, is the pass in order?... Very well, you have my authority.What's all that about?We have a visitor. Now Bruce, you're going to get your proof, but I want you to do one thing.What?I want you to take my two friends to the gates and see they get away all right.What are you going to do?You are to go straight to the TARDIS as soon as you can.No. Wait a minute...What is this ""Tardis""?It's a sort of spacesh... house. House we live in.I don't think you heard me the first time. What are you going to do?Please eat some of them Colin.I will, but later.He's coming back.Right, this time I'm going to have it out with Salamander.Who's that?Where are you?Keep away. Get back.I've come to help you.The radiation!Please, don't. Please...It's a girl, a human being.And the radiation.What's the matter with you? Are you all mad? Get back! Get back!Oooh. Thanks.First, don't move. I don't know who you are, but you must be carrying radiation.What?You're from the surface, aren't you?Radiation? How'd you get down here?Did you see Salamander? And Swann? What about Swann?Swann sent me.Swann? Where is he?He's dead.You see, Colin, Salamander was right. He always said if we went up to the surface we'd die of radiation.No, not radiation. Salamander killed him.No. No. I don't believe her. She's lying.He's been keeping you prisoners, I don't know why.No. No.Now listen to me...Now wait! We must decontaminate you. There's equipment in Salamander's control room. In there.Yes. In here.In there.See. Radiation.You can come out now.I'm alright?Yes. Now, tell us. What's this about Swann?No. Just watch. Look at the meter.The machine's a fake. Is this ruler contaminated? Look. See those valves. There's an invisible ray. Break it, and it works the meter.But Salamander...He built it. He always uses it when he comes down.Yes I know, to try to convince you for some reason or other that there's radiation above ground.There is. The war.War? What war?Where is he? Where's Salamander?That's just what I would like to know.Wait. Where are you going?Leader Salamander's orders.What orders?He's released us.I wasn't informed.I was.Where are the release papers?Are you questioning my word?No, of course not, sir, but there are strict rules.Rules? Really? You forget, I'm world Security Controller. I make rules and break them. And men, Captain. Come on, you two.Find Deputy Benik. Quickly.Sir!But I can only take two at a time.I'm sure they all understand that.Where is he? I must find Salamander.Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with them?No. Now that Swann's dead you two seem to be the leaders. After what you've told me we must confront the man that started all this, face to face.Yes, sir, the door's jammed and I can't get a view of the inside of it all.Right. So Bruce and the rest of them are in the interrogation room?Yes sir. The Captain felt something was wrong and so do I sir. One minute Leader Salamander's locked in the Records room, the next he's in the interrogation room. It doesn't make sense, sir.Of course it doesn't make sense if you haven't got any sense. Just stand guard and try and keep your wits about you.Yes sir.Giles Kent. What are you doing here?Oh, I've been looking forward to this meeting. You're getting careless. You didn't double lock the doors. Oh, its all right, I've done it now. The only way anybody can get through there is to blast their way through.How did you get into the Research Centre?Oh, you know me. There isn't a pass in the world I can't get my hands on if I put my mind to it.You won't find it so easy getting out.Really? Well we'll see. I'm not on my own this time. I've got friends here with me. And between us we're going to fix you once and for all.You always were a tiresome man, Kent.I'm going to be more than tiresome this time. You know the biggest mistake you ever made was not killing me when you had the chance.Oh so you going to kill me huh? How petty. What good do you think that will do?Hold it! Now don't move quickly, my nerves are a bit shaky at the moment.We must get in there somehow.We can't without the emergency key, and Salamander has it in there.We could burn our way in.Never.Why not?It's an X-structure alloy, you'd hardly scratch the surface.We'll have to try it. Get the gear up here. Fast!Ha ha ha. Never get away with it? Oh, that's good, coming from you. Don't you realize you're dispensable, and the world is going to get along fine without you from now on. The only good idea you ever had in your life was getting rid of me and you couldn't even do that properly, could you? Ha ha ha. And now I'm back and you're finished.Oh, what's that?They're breaking down the door.They don't appear to be having much success.It's not cutting, sir.Never mind, keep at it.It's no good sir.Keep going!You're trapped, aren't you?You're a fool, Salamander. You don't think I'd forgotten already, do you?What?I've been with you too many times in this room in the past, not to know where this leads to.Your little bolt-hole. Halfway down the tunnel. A passage out to the fields and enough explosives down there to stop you or your thugs following me.Well that's very interesting Mister Kent. Why didn't you tell me that before?Oh no, it can't be.Oh, I'm afraid it is. Oh look. Here's another surprise for you. Look behind you.Astrid, you've come just in time.It's too late, Giles, I know everything.That's him, that's the man who took us down there in the first place.Giles Kent, we thought you were dead.Now look, I've never seen these people before in my life.They told me everything. You and Salamander were in it together......You built an atomic shelter, took some people down for an endurance test. The next person they saw was Salamander......who told them that an atomic war had started.You see, Kent...Oh, be careful, Doctor. He'll kill you.You kept us down like animals.Why? Why did you do it to us?We had to have someone create the natural disasters, didn't we, and we fooled you all!You didn't fool me, Kent...You didn't suspect me.Any man who resorts to murder as eagerly and as rapidly as you must be suspect. You didn't just want to expose Salamander, you wanted to kill him and take his place.And I will! Think you're going to stop me? And these people? Now move out of the way, quick! We'll see who'll stop me!Huh, he's going to try and blow the place up!Come on then!No! Don't touch that door, it's red hot.What do you mean?Well it's locked. They're trying to burn through from the other side.Look!It looks like some sort of cave.It's the escape route. Salamander!Yes. I wonder if he knows Kent's on his way?Still no good, sir.Come on, man. Can't you increase the power?No sir. Get back!About time, Forrester.Don't shoot, don't shoot.I demand a trial, Bruce, a fair trial.What a nasty little man you are, to be sure. Forrester, I want all research personnel detained, and you can begin with Benik, here. Take him away.Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me out there? Bruce?Can you hear me?Yes, Doctor.Oh, there you are. I think Kent is going to try to blow us up. Any chance of getting us out of here? Things are going to turn rather nasty in a minute.We're doing our best, Doctor.Oh. Well if you can't you better leave with your men. There's no point in us all going up in smoke.You always were a fool, weren't you?Now wait a minute. They'll be after both of us now.Oh no they won't.I tell you, they know!So what you want me to do, huh? Bury our differences, hmm? I didn't need you once, I still don't need you.Now wait a minute. The place is mined, we know that. We planned it for years, together. Between us we can destroy them all, and the evidence. Just you and me, Salamander.You and me? What use are you to me? You were useful once, but now...No. No...Ha ha ha ha. You won't get away from me, Kent. Ha ha ha ha.Ha ha hah. I told you you could not escape me.Well if I'm going to die, Salamander, you'll die with me.No! No!Aaaaaaa!Come on Doctor, let's get out of here.Salamander, Giles, they're dead.Come along man, quickly.The people...People. What people?The people underground in the deep shelter.They may have been killed.I promised Swann I'd get them out.But that's not your fault. You couldn't have done more.There's a TV monitor screen in there. There must be a link to the deep shelter.It's alright! They're alive!How are you going to get to them?There's a tunnel from outside. We can get to it outside the Research Station.But that's probably been destroyed by the explosion.We'll get to them somehow.Lookout!Get me some men. I'll lead them.Alright. I'll go with you.Oh good then. That's splendid. I'll come too.Oh no Doctor. It's far too dangerous. They might mistake you as Salamander.Oh yes. Ooooh.Are you hurt?Oh I'm alright. I'll come with you as far as the gates. Come along, we must go.I thought you were never coming.Hey Doctor, are you alright?Oh there you are Doctor. You do look in a state. Come and sit down.I told you it wouldn't be long. You, you worry too much.We shouldn't have left him.You see, after the explosion, Doctor, we dinna know what to do. You said to come back here, which we did, but I'm sure we were followed.Please, can we start straight away?Me, Doctor? But you said we were never to touch the controls.Quite right, Jamie. Welcome to the TARDIS.Thank you. You're doing so well impersonating me, ah, I thought I might return the compliment.And Giles Kent?Unfortunately, didn't survive the explosion.We're going to put you outside, Salamander, no friends, no safety, nothing. You'll run, but they'll catch up with you.No!And now I'm going to kill you.No you don't.Oh, Doctor!Victoria! Jamie! Hold onto something!Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!Jamie! Oh!Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

Phase one evacuation....determine the extent ofbreakdown factor in ionisation...Why has the ioniser been allowedto deteriorate to danger level?There was a power stoppage.I've done all I can to boost it.Well it can't be allowedto fall any lower.We still have time to evacuate.We will certainly not evacuate.We've beaten its tantrums before.It's falling again.Well hold it... steadyI can't.



Switch the stabilising circuitsthrough to the computer.I have, it's still not holding!All circuits, woman, all circuits!We're nearly there.There's not enough power.It's slowing down.Maybe it'll hold there.I doubt it.Well, at least it gives us time.We need Scientist Penley.He is no longer a member of thispost. You will make this machine work.Yes, Leader Clent.That's better.Emergency evacuation phasing set?



Yes.loniser state fault check?Yes.Reactor safety sequencein operation. Good.You'll make an organiserfirst class yet, Miss Garrett.I only follow yourexample, Leader Clent.What is the latest reportfrom all other ioniser bases?All bases are in phase. America: glaciers held. Australasia: glaciersheld. South Africa: glaciers held. Asia: some improvement claimed.They would!Britannicus Base, Europe: slippingout of phase. Glacial advance imminent.If we fail, the whole program forglacier containment is in danger.I'm fully aware of that fact.But in two hours, theioniser will be useless.And then the glaciers will move again... 5000 yearsof history... crushed beneath a moving mountain of ice.Phase two evacuation. Emergency. Phase twoevacuation. Red state emergency. Red state emergency.Priority override.Yes, of course. ButPenley was the expert.I've had enough of experts.Their crazy ideas. Where's Arden?Still at the ice face, completingthe instrumentation project.Well, hasn't he been warned?We couldn't get through...Well we have to tell him, immediately!I cannot lose any more men!Leader Clent to Scientist Ardenat glacier face, come in Arden!Walters, through here. Now clear that...Sir. Get your drill ready, Davis.Sir!Yes?Come quickly, Sir!I could swear there's something inside.Oh, not another mastodon.Well look for yourself, Sir.Is it a man?Perhaps it's an animal.Well we'll soon find out.Davis, the heavy drill.Yes Sir.Base calling, Sir.What do they want?There's nothing coming through. Poorreception. I suppose they might...They'll have to wait. This ismore important. Come on Davis.Well what are we going to do, Sir?Do? Excavate. This couldbe a brilliant discovery.But Sir- the computerised schedule! We must stick to that.Oh, must we?Leader Clent will be furious, Sir.Well that's just too bad. For once we'lldo something on our own account, eh?There's not much base can do about it Sir,after all, we can't even ask permission, can we?Come on Davis, hurry man!Arden, for heavens sakeman, come in! This is urgent!_ again. _ is decreasing. Notfar from total disintegration.Arrgh!What's the matter?You're on my head!Careful!Come on, Victoria. Give me your hand.It was a blind landing.Is that what you call it?Well no broken bones.Hey, look at the snow.Oh no, not again! Tibet was bad enough, but I thinkyou've put us down just further up the mountain!Well let's see, shall we? Very careful, I'mgoing to get out. It's quite a long drop.Come on Victoria, that's right.Hey, looks like a greatbig wall of ice. Look!Ooohhh!What is it?You're on my hand!But Doctor, look.Yes, that's not ice, that's plastic.Yes and, see how smoothit is, and curved.It's a dome. A protective dome.It's so big. Can't see the endof it. Wonder what's inside.Don't worry, those alarms weren't meantfor us. I wonder what's wrong, though.Ach, that's their problem. Come on.Leader Clent! The video!Arden has made contact.Arden! Can you hear me?Yes. What is it?You must return to base immediately.Well don't panic. I've almost finished settingup the seismograph probe. Davis hurry up.Well... the ioniser's nearlyat disintegration point.Oooh, I wonder ifPenley's ears are burning.It's not a laughing matter,man! You know what it means.Yes, cold weather ahead. Ithought it felt a bit nippy.There'll be a full enquiry intoyour delay, you realise that.Yes, and I've got a very good reason.A fantastic discovery, in the ice.Your task was to set up movement probes inthe ice, not indulge in amateur archaeology.This is a man!Well, congratulations. Makes a changefrom fossils. Now leave it and return.I'm bringing the body back with me.Arden.I'm sorry, I can't hear you.There seems to some interference.Arden!Oh, Doctor, it's just like my home.I know!Red state emergency. Evacuation phase three. Phase three evacuate.Transport section leaders report now. Phase three evacuation.Something's wrong.Seems safe enough.Oh, thank you.Thank you. Excuse me Miss, I'm Jamie McCrimmon,do you think you could tell us where we are?She doesn't want to know, Jamie.Hey, this says we're onevacuation flight seven.Yes, rather inhospitable,we've only just arrived!Mmm.Hey, and this tag, itsays I'm a scavenger!And yours does too!Hey, we're not beggars!Hush Jamie.What is it Doctor?Sounds like electronic machinery, like acomputer.

That's bad.Now balance those gauges, MissHenry. 17 degrees out from normal.17 degrees? Well this is serious!One-three-seven-nine,now...Who the blazes are you? Getthese scavengers out of here!We're not scavengers!Out of here!No! In two minutes 38 seconds, you're going tohave an almighty explosion! The readings say so!Well how do you possibly know that, I haven't even, Ihaven't even processed them through the computer yet!I don't need a computer!If he's right it'salready too late to escape!No it isn't, it doesn't haveto happen, if you'll excuse me.Cut out the reactor!There's insufficient power for that.Well a quick short burst thenfrom the reactor unit, now.Off!Now link the circuit,with the reactor link.Now, bring in the computer stabiliser.Yes, yes, that should hold it steady. It's a, it's not aperfect job, mind you. You ought to get an expert in, you know.How did you...

He looks pre-Viking. But no suchcivilisation existed in prehistoric times before the first ice age.Ha! Proper ""Ice Warrior"", isn't he, Sir?I reckon Leader Clent will be interested.Yes. What'll the mightycomputer make of it, eh?Sir, hadn't we better get backwhile the weather still holds?Good point Walters. Davis, try bringingthe air-sled a little closer, will you?What are they up to?Arden's found something in the ice. Somethingto take back to Clent. It won't be appreciated.Ar, they ought to leave way alone.Arden was always a researcher. He wantedto be an archaeologist when I knew him.Archaeology. What good's that?It's good to know things,even when they're dead.Nothing's sacred to you, is it?I only ask questions, it'sin my character I suppose.Ar, you swore you'd give all that up.Discovery's as exciting to me as the hunt is to you. But with Clent,he uses scientists' craniums as stepping stones for his ambitions.Ar, that's about allyou lot are fit for...Well we're not totally useless, surely?To me you are. Come on, we've got tomove. Leave them to... stupid games.Avalanche! Come on!Where's Davis?Storr! Come on! Avalanche!Storr, are you alright?Penley...What's the damage?My arm. It's gone I think.Broken?Feels like it.Well you're lucky. There's one down therewho's staying on the mountain for good.They'll... they'll come looking for him. We must move out abit. Unless you fancy trying to turn me over to your friends.Six weeks ago they were my friends,but not anymore. Can you walk?Aye. Just you try and keep up. Come on.All clear, Sir.Yes, but how 'bout Davis?I'll go look for him.Well let's hope he's safe. With anotherman gone, Clent'll skin me alive.Well if he gets too difficult, you canalways set your warrior on him, eh Sir?But you've no valid proofof your qualifications?Look, aren't we wasting time?If you want our help, whynot tell us all about it?All about it? All about what?Where have you been all these years?Well, er, as a matter of fact, we've, we've beenin retreat. In, in Tibet. We are sanctifiers.Oh, I see. In Tibet. Well if you'll take a simple test,I'll soon know if you're up to our scientific standards.I see, and er, if I fail?You'll be evacuated with theother scavengers in due course.Oh, where to?The African rehabilitationcentres, of course.Oh no, not Africa.Very well, fire away.I present you a problem.Yes.All the major continents are threatened withdestruction, under the glaciers of the second ice age.Oh.How would you halt the ice surge, and turn the climateback to normal? 45 seconds, starting from... now.Oh, er, ahem, er, possible causes,er, the reversal of the magnetic field.No such change has occurred.Um, interstellar clouds,er, obscuring the suns rays.An excessive burst of sunspot activity.A severe shift of theEarth's angle of rotation.Come on Doctor.There aren't that many alternatives.Gigantic heat loss, eh? Er.I asked for an answer, not aquestion. Twelve seconds left.Oh. Er. Oh well. Ahem. In that case the answer's simple. A severe dropin the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's lower atmosphere. Is that it?I would use ionisation.Well, is he right?Yes, he is.But I still don't understand.Well the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's atmosphere helps retainthe suns heat. Take that gas away, and there's a sudden freeze up.Oh, where does the gas go to?Well...You know how efficient our civilisation is, thanks to the direction of the great world computer. And you also know how we conquered the problem of world famine acentury ago by artificial food. On the land that was once used to grow the food we needed, we built up-to-date living units, to house the ever-increasing population.Up to date?Well there were exceptions, of course. I mean this house was classified as being historicinterest. So, the amount of growing plants on the planet, was reduced to an absolute minimum.No plants, no carbon dioxide.Then suddenly, one year,there was no spring.Even then it wasn't understood. Notuntil the ice-caps began to advance.Er, but er, what's this ioniser?Um, Miss Garrett.lonisation is a method of intensifying the sunsheat onto the Earth, but into particular areas.Yeah, it's like amagnifying glass, Jamie.Oh, aye.You mean you can melt glaciersand change the weather?Um, when certaindifficulties are overcome.Precise control is not easy.We can't afford to make mistakes. lonisation canproduce temperatures intense enough to melt rock.Only by maintaining a perfect balancecan we prevent widespread flooding.Can't your computers solvethe problem of control?Of course they can!Well?When the input data is completethey will give us the solution.Oh, I see. And when will that be?Soon Doctor, soon.What's the position now?Well we're barely holding the glacier in check. Nowthere you see a world map of the situation at the moment.And there you see what's, erm, going on in our sector. But if we fail, then not only will Europe beswallowed up, but the balance of power will be ruined, and the whole world program will, will go under.And the glaciers will win.My senior scientist Penley, is missing. I think you have thecapabilities to join us here. This great mission. Will you help us?Well I, I'm willing to try.Jolly good. Jolly good. Er, Miss Garrett will give you somebackground information. You've worked with computers, I presume?Er, only when I have to.Well Miss Garrett is our computerspecialist, she'll help you.Oh, I'll try and remember that.Here we are completely computerised.Oh never mind.Every decision is checked, to eliminate risk of failure. Because ofcourse, all decisions, all actions, must conform to the common good.This way, gentlemen, this way. Right.Now do be careful. 'Roundhere. Steady with her.Is this... your full co-operation, Arden?How do you expect us to carry out this...Great heavens.Yes, I thought you'd be impressed Clent.Right chaps, lets have him over here...This way, this way...What is it?It looks like a Vikingwarrior. Look at the helmet.Frozen for centuries in the ice.Perfectly preserved. Hm, that's odd though.What? Who are you?An addition to our staff,Arden. What's odd Doctor?Well the helmet, it's wrong. When this man wasfrozen to death only primitive cavemen existed.Well I say it's an undiscoveredcivilisation. Think of the implications!Well whatever the implications, it must still take second place to out ioniser project.We have our daily planning conference in three minutes fifteen seconds, exactly.Come along Arden! Play withyour toy after the meeting.Well, what's supposed to happen, Doctor?You see this fellow Arden has set the electricity so thatthe ice melts very slowly, allowing for the resistance.It's working quite quickly.Well, I suspect there are someimpurities in the ice. I say.Look at that.What is it?It's an electronicconnection. I'm sure of it.It can't be.Now you wait here, and,and don't touch anything.What's got into him all of a sudden?I don't know. Scientists areall alike, eureka and all that.Aye. Could do with a go on this, maybe.Er, Victoria.What?You see how those lassies were dressed?Yes I did. And trust you tothink of something like that.What? Couldn't help thinking about it.Well I think it's disgusting,wearing that kind of thing.Oh, aye, so it is, so it is. You er, youdon't see yourself dressed like that then?Jamie!Oh, I'm sorry, it was just an idea.We will now change the subject,please. I want to look at this man.

You must come with me.- I see, Thonmi.- After we've had a little chat.- Khrisong will be waiting!Nobody seems to want to listen to me, andeveryone is jumping to the wrong conclusions.You seem to be a reasonable sort of chap.What's going on here?We are besieged. The Yeti have turned upon us.- At least, that is what we thought until...- Until I turned up. I see...Every time I visit Detsen,the monastery is in some sort of trouble.



- You were here before?- That attack in 1630. How did it end?You know our history.- A little.- That was also a dark period.It was then our holy Ghantawas taken from us.Oh, dear. Never mind. I'm sure it'll turn up again.- Legend tells us so, but...- This chap Travers...This chap Travers, what of him?There is no time to talk. Khrisong will be angry.Yes, he may be angry,but he's not the Abbot, is he?- No.- I don't think the Abbot will be angry- when he sees what I've brought with me.- What do you mean? Show me.I want you to help me to get this to the Abbot.Why this delay?Seize him. Take him to the gate.Abbot! The straw!Follow me.- The Tardis is that way!- I know, but we must warn the Doctor!We don't even know where he is. Run!Khrisong.- Khrisong.- Do not interfere, Rinchen.Did we not decideto consult the Abbot Songsten?We?You mean YOU had decided.- The time for talk is past.- But the Abbot must...Must I always consult the Abbotbefore I take any decisive action?Travers, don't you thinkthis has gone far enough?- There's nothing I can do.- What do you hope to gain?- Time.- Time?You've killed my companion, but you won'tget another chance to get in my way.I shall find the Yeti, with or without help.- You can't possibly leave...- Can't I?You'll be safe here,and I know where you are. I'm going.Don't worry. The monks won't harm you.- They're men of peace.- Men of peace?You are asking us...You are asking us to agree to murder.No. Our hands will be clean.After deliberately using him as bait?You cannot be so ruthless.Sapan, I believe that this man is,for some reason,trying to turn the Yeti into savage creatures.- But what proof is there?- You've heard the word of Travers.He is an Englishman. A stranger.He's a killer.Let me tie him to the gate.If the Yeti come to rescue him,we will know the truth..... and my warriors will be waiting.- But if he is innocent?- My warriors will protect him.Khrisong, there may be wisdomin what you say.- All we ask is that you wait until...- No!I have done with waiting.Bring him to the gate!Master Abbot.Abbot Songsten.- Forgive me, Abbot.- Thonmi!- I am sorry, but...- You know well that only I may enter here.What is this?Where did you get this?Is it not the Ghanta that was lost?It is, my son.200 years or more, it has been lost to us.How came you by it?It is the master. Padmasambhava.Do not be afraid.Answer him.A stranger brought it, master.The DoctorISoI He has returnedIBring the Ghanta to me, my son.Both of you.Do not be afraid, Thonmi.Ralpachan, watch from the window there.You, the other window.Any attempt to rescue youwill now be highly dangerous for you.Look, nobody IS going to rescue me,least of all an Abominable Snowman!Hasn't it occurred to you that whatever's beenkilling your monks might very well kill me?If you are innocent, then let us hopethat we will have the time to rescue you.- I think we've shaken it off.- Have we? Oh, good.Come on. It can't be much further.- Listen!- What is it?Something's coming. Come on!- Who are you? What are you doing here?- We're going to the monastery.Are you indeed?You're a strange pairto find roaming around these mountains.- Are you with that newspaper fellow?- What do you mean?- He says he's a doctor.- Have you seen him?- Yes, I've seen him.- Is he all right?Yes, he's quite all right.So, you're going to the monastery,are you? Good.There'll be quite a welcome waiting for you.The Doctor said there would be.- Did he, now?- I wouldn't go that way if I were you.- Wouldn't you?- There's something up there.A great hairy beastie.- Where?- In a cave.- A cave? Have you found their cave?- Aye.- Will you show me where it is?- We couldn't go back there.Stop playing games. I know thatyou and that Doctor fellow are after the Yeti.Yeti? What's he talking about?You mean you're not partof some press expedition?- Expedition?- We're just visiting the monastery.- But the cave...- If you want to tangle with that beastie,- I'll show you the cave.- You will?After you've shown ushow to get to the monastery.I've nothing to lose, I suppose.All right. Come with me.Tell me, my son.Is the Doctor alone?Yes, master.We are gratefulfor the return of the holy Ghanta.The Doctor is our friend.He must be treated with respect and kindness.Thonmi...You will go to Khrisong.Tell him the Abbotorders the release of the Doctor.Go now.Remember, these wordswere spoken by the Abbot here.You will forget that you have entered this room,or that you have spoken to me.Therefore, Songsten,we must make certain that Doctorlearns nothing of what is happening.He is a man of great knowledgeand intelligence,but he may not show sympathyfor the powers that guide us.He may even seek to hinder the Great Plan.It might be wiseif he departs as soon as possible.In the rocks! Did you see something?Something is coming! The Yeti!Oh, no!Be ready to kill them!Jamie! Victoria! Keep back!Keep back! They'll kill you!Keep away! Get away!You see? I was right.Khrisong! It was all a mistake.Doctor!I've talked to these two. I'm sorry.This is not the man that attacked me.- Seize them.- What's going on?- He's led you into a trap!- No, Doctor...Silence! Who are these people?- They're friends of his.- Then they shall act as hostages also.- Where have you been?- With the Abbot. We must release him.This stranger has brought back to usthe holy Ghanta that was lost.We must treat him with respect and kindness.These are the words of our Abbot.- Is this true?- Of course.Then why did you not tell me?You'd already accused me of murder.You were hardly in the right frame of mindto listen to my story of how I came by the bell.Oh, please.This wasn't the welcome I expected, you know!As for you, Travers...It is well to rememberthat nothing must disturb our preparations.There is little time left now.How, if the Doctor will not go...His life could be in great danger.He has been a good friend in the past.It would be ill if the lifeof such a one became imperilled.- You found this in the cave?- Aye.- There were lots of them.- What do you think it is?I've no idea. This creature, what was it like?It was huge, and all covered with hair.Like a sort of bear.- It attacked us.- It sounds like your Abominable Snowman.They wouldn't attack anyone.They're shy, elusive creatures.Why do you think it's taken meso long to track them down?What made this? I wonder what it's for.Oh, well... I'd like to see one of these creatures.- It was horrible.- It was buried under tons of rock,- yet it still got up and came after us.- Fear makes us imagine things.Including creaturesthat don't seem to be flesh and blood.Khrisong!What's the matter?- Come quickly!- What is it?Look!There they are at last!Yeti! After all these years!Stand watch at the wall. I want two meneither side of here. Thonmi, come with me.- They're magnificent!- Do you think they'll attack?- I don't know.- They won't attack anyone. They're timid.Could you capture one?I would like to examine one.- Aye, we'll wrap it up for you- Thank you.Thonmi, come. We must see to the defences.Boy, open the gates.If you want to capture one of these beasties,I have an idea that might just work.Victoria, this is one of those instanceswhere discretion is the better part of valour.Jamie has an idea. Come along.Have no fear.Now that the holy Ghantahas been returned to us, all will be well.What if the Yeti do attack?Have faith, Rinchen.Khrisong and his warriors will protect us.Khrisong is a rash man.He was so sure that this Doctorwas a threat to us.I can assure you I am not.I hope this is going to work.Are you ready up there? Catch!- There is one coming!- One's enough.The others don't seem to be moving.Keep it back. I'm not ready for it yet.Stand by. Here it comes.Now!Haul on the rope. Quick with the net!Pull hard that way!Wait.- It's dead.- Aye.Why aren't the others attacking?They're going!Good! Let's get this one inside.You were right about one thing, Victoria.This creature certainlydoesn't seem to be flesh and blood.It's not your Abominable Snowman either,Travers.- Metal.- That's incredible!- What is it?- A devil's warrior.No, I don't think so. It's more like a robot.A robot? Don't let your imaginationrun away with you!Why has it stopped?Wait a minute... Wait a minute!- Nothing there.- No.But there has been!

        Sincro: wyxchariIt's alright, they were on their own. OK Weams, no sense in wasting any more time. Off you go.Right, sir.Come on, let us out! Let us out!It's no good, Jamie, they can't hear!... What have we done?Not we, Victoria - me. I'm the one that's to blame. I should have told them about the Doctor.A doctor! Well, if he was anywhere near those explosives when they went up...Yes sir. Don't you think I should go and have a look, sir? The youngsters said he was following the cable.Yes, you'd better.Sir!Oh, and Staff, take someone with you.



Sir!Sir?Yes, Weams?This blast recorder ain't working, sir.Rubbish. Miss Travers checked it!Well it ain't registered, sir.He's right!But it fired - look at the circuits! You can't have an explosion without a blast, can you?Well, come to think of it, we didn't hear anything either. We should have heard something, even at this distance.Yes.Sir, this Doctor bloke that's in the tunnel - he could have tampered with the charges, you know.Sabotage... I think it's time we had a chat with those two youngsters.You mustn't blame yourself, Jamie. After all, the Doctor did tell us to be careful. Now we still don't know who these people are.No, we don't know anything, except the Doctor might have been blown to kingdom come.



Sit down, both of you.Is it bad news, then?Oh, no - well at least, we hope not.We don't know for the moment. I've sent a couple of men along the tunnel to investigate. But that's not why I came in here. You three are up to something, and I mean to find out what.We're up to something? Now just a moment. Suppose you tell us first just what's going on down here.How did you get into the tunnel? Or let me put it another way - where did you break in?We didn't break in.But you must have done. All the stations are sealed, aren't they?We just arrived - we were brought here.Sir, Lane's got Holborn on the line. Sounds like trouble.Yeti?Could be, sir. Something's up.OK, Weams.Yeti? Did he say Yeti?Hello, hello, Holborn?... This is HQ to Holborn. Can you hear me?... Not a sausage.There must be someone manning the phone.OK, Lane, what gives?Well, it's just firing at the other end, sir.Firing?Yes, sir. Listen.Oh, good grief, no!Hello, HQ to Holborn?What happened, Lane?Well, it was difficult to hear, sir. I think the truck was late getting there...Then what?Well they must have got the ammo unloaded, sir, 'cos he says they were jumped when they were moving.Take O'Brien and a couple of the others.Sir! Come on, mate.Here, you're not going out there?Yes, Mr Chorley. Want to come? Report some action first hand?Well, I don't think I'd better get in the way. I... er... think I'd better stay here, don't you?Yes. Yes, I think you better had.There hasn't been an explosion, Staff!I can see that, lad... Here!No sign of that Doctor bloke.No... here, give me a hand with this.It's our detonator, alright. It's fired, too... 'ere, hang on a minute. All the ammo, Staff. If it's fired, then why didn't...Yeah, why didn't this tunnel go up?... No damage at all...Yet something blew up here!It's obvious, ain't it? It's been got at.Where's that Doctor? That's what I'd like to know.Father?Hmm...?The soldiers have found two youngsters in the tunnels. They seem to know a great deal about the Yeti.Oh?They know they're robots!What!And they know about the control spheres, too.But they can't have - I mean, the public were never told!I know.Well, where are they?Don't you see, it makes sense, Victoria! If the Yeti are in London, then the Intelligence is here too!What, you mean controlling them?Aye, and not only them! Look, it must have been the Intelligence that got hold of us in space, and it must have brought us here.Oh, but why?I wish I knew. Revenge perhaps.Hmm... Well now, you've got some explaining to do, haven't you?We have? Now look here...Now now, just what do you know about the Yeti?Quite a lot, but before we go into all...And the spheres? Where'd you find out about them?That's none of your business. I'd just like to...Who are you?I'd like to ask you the same question!Wait a minute, Jamie! I'm Victoria Waterfield......and that's Jamie McCrimmon!Father?But it... it can't be...Why that's... that's over... forty years ago!What's going on here?Oh Jamie, don't you recognise him? It's Professor Travers.So it is! Professor Travers! Here, hasn't he got old!Huh?Oh, but we're very pleased to see you, Professor, very pleased.The time machine... it was all true then?The TARDIS - I mean aye, of course it's true! Hey, do you know what's happened to the Doctor?Oh, is he safe?Isn't he with you?No, he's in the tunnels. Arnold's gone to look for him. Father, what is going on?Oh dear, I do hope he's alright. Come on, Jamie, let's go and find out if he's got back yet.Father!Eh? Oh, Victoria, try and explain to Anne, will you?... It's alright, Victoria, you were born... I mean... She was born years before I was!A time machine?Oh dear!The Captain's been gone about twenty minutes, you say?Yes, Staff.Quite a battle - I should think we've lost those chaps bringing back the ammo.Well it's to be hoped you're wrong, Mr Chorley. Alright, Blake, you can stand down now. You too, Weams.Righto, Staff.Ah, Sergeant, the Doctor. Is he alright?He weren't killed in the explosion, if that's what you mean.Oh, thank heavens!For the simple reason that there weren't no explosion.What?Somebody had tampered with it - and it's my guess it was this Doctor feller.What rot, Arnold, the Doctor's a friend of mine. He's the one man that can help us!Is he now? Well, he weren't nowhere to be seen; he'd disappeared.Do you think the Yeti got him?No.What makes you so sure?Dunno - just a hunch.Hey, wait a minute, where d'you think you're going?He may be lying injured!No, we'd have found him. Unless you know where he is?I might...Take me to him, could you?Aye.Right, well come on, lad!It flies? Through time and space?Not exactly ""flies""... it's difficult to explain.Not half as difficult as it is to believe!Your father believes it.Yes... yes, he seems to. And you met him - when was it you said? In 1935? In Tibet?Yes!You couldn't possibly have. You're no older than... but you seem to know about the Tibet business... Why didn't my father tell anyone about this Doctor friend of yours and his TARDIS?You're his daughter, and even you find it difficult to believe. So how would other people react?Sorry to barge in. Left my typewriter in here, and I want to knock up a quick piece about this mysterious Doctor chap. A bit of a turn-up for the book, wasn't it? Any theories?On what?On what the Doctor and these two kids were doing in the tunnel.Mushrooming?No, seriously.Ask a silly question...Well hasn't she told you anything?Nothing that you could print, Mr Chorley.Oh for goodness sake, why is everybody being so evasive? Why won't anybody answer any questions?Perhaps they're afraid you'll interpret them in your own inimitable style.And what does that mean, pray?It means you have a reputation for distorting the truth. You take reality, and you make it into a comic strip - in short, Mr Chorley, you are a sensationalist.You smug little redbrick university...Don't say it, Mr Chorley, I have a very quick temper and very long claws.There's no sense in losing our temper, Miss Travers. I'm sorry that my journalistic style doesn't appeal to you, but there are millions of people who...Yes, the Gutter Press has a very large following.Yes, it does, it does indeed, and you'd do very well to remember that, because I intend to print all the facts when we get out of here.If we get out of here - the Yeti, remember?I'm not forgetting. In fact, I think our little friend here could tell us a few things about them. It was quite a coincidence, wasn't it, you three pitching up when you did.What do you mean?Ah, don't give us the innocent bit, love. You know very well that the Doctor sabotaged that explosion.Mr Chorley, what are you talking about?Arnold's just come back and confirmed there was no explosion in the tunnel - and the only person who was in there, as far as we know, was your Doctor friend.If the Doctor did stop it, he had a very good reason.Yes, well we'll find out soon enough, because Arnold's just taken the lad back in to hunt him out.Jamie's gone into the tunnel?Right, Thompson, that's the best we can do. Now go and tell the Corporal to get the men back here as fast as he can...No, you're too late. Stay where you are.Lane? Lane! Fall back, you'll never hold them!Will nothing stop them?Come on, back!We couldn't hold 'em, sir. They're coming, two of 'em! They got O'Brien and Cocksey, nothing stops them!It's Staff Arnold!Yeah, come on.Captain?Yeti!They got two of us!And the ammo detail - they're all gone.What's the plan then?I brought a load of explosives down from Holborn. I'm going to blow it - and them with it.Taking a bit of a risk, aren't you, sir?Yeah, I know.Hey, look what's happening!What are they doing?Looks like the cobwebs!Cobwebs or not, I'm going to blow it sky high. Get back!What's that noise?The boxes are pulsating!Get back!Chorley's an idiot - telling Victoria the boy's gone. Those two are all that child's got in the world.I asked her to make some tea - thought it would take her mind off things.Oh, good idea. Switch the soldering iron on, would you?Father?Hmm?Have you ever seen this TARDIS?No, no, I can't say I have.It all sounds a bit far-fetched to me.You know, I think the Doctor's at the back of all this.What do you mean?Doesn't it strike you as odd that on the two occasions you've encountered the Yeti, you've also come across the Doctor?Well?Well, it's obvious - he controls them!Oh, but surely...What? Oh, tea. Thank you, my dear.Oh, aren't you having any?No, I think I'll go and lie down for a bit.Good idea.Do you think she heard?No... in any case, what you say is nonsense, Anne. I saw the Doctor defeat those robots and save Detsen Monastery. He wouldn't do that if he was in league with them, now would he?No, no I suppose not. In a situation like this one imagines all sorts of things...This waiting's getting on my nerves. Why the heck don't they do something?Steady, lad. We'll know soon enough.We can't just stand here. Can't we make a run for it?We wouldn't stand a chance, not with them switched on.How do you know that?It's alright, sir. The Professor's vouched for him. Understand he knows a great deal about these robots.See, you have to find out...What's that?What made them do that, I wonder?Couldn't say, sir. But I don't think we should stay to find out.Yes, you're right, Staff. Come on, let's get back.Wait - can we not just see what they're up to?No! If there's one thing that I've learned, it's never push your luck. Now come on.Tibet? Tibet? You're joking.That's where old Travers says they come from. He reckons they're Abominable Snowmen.Well, he's off his chump, ain't he? How'd they get here in the first place?Come through the post, don't they?Nah, seriously. Outer space, that's where they come from. Well that's what I reckon, anyway.Oh do leave off! You've been reading too many kids' comics, you have!Alright then, Corp, where do they come from?It's a foreign power, ain't it? Bacteriological warfare, that's what that stuff is in the tunnels.What, that fungus stuff?Yeah. And them Yeti are some sort of new weapon. Well, a sort of robot army.What, you mean it ain't real then?Well of course they ain't, you nit! Otherwise we'd be able to knock 'em out with the small arms, wouldn't we?Yeah - nothing hardly touches 'em, does it?Not unless you can cop 'em straight between the eyes. Then they've had it.Yeah, well that'll take some doing. I mean, I'd have a job just holding me arm steady if one of them ugly creeps came at me, wouldn't I?I wish we had some more hand grenades, 'cos they're the things that seem to stop 'em dead in their tracks.Yeah, but we ain't got any, have we?.It's a pity that ammo truck they stopped at Holborn had all the gear in.Stone me! 'Ere, we ain't got much of a chance if we come up against that lot, 'ave we?Not with the funny old crowd we got down here with us. You got civvies, RE's, REME...'Ere, watch it, mate!The lot. A right old Fred Karno's Army, innit? Still, not to worry, me old son. Not the end of the world, is it? Want some more tea?Yeah, alright then.Well move then!Here, Corp, look at this!What... oh crikey! That's what comes of talking about it!It's that fungus stuff, it's moving again!Oh Anne, come and do this for me, would you?Alright, father.It's my hands - can't control 'em! Getting old, that's my trouble.Don't worry!Can't help it - I feel... responsible somehow. If only the Doctor would turn up. I'm sure he could help us.'Scuse me, sir...Eh, what?That fungus stuff, it's on the move again. Euston Square's gone.Come on, let's have a look!It's on the move again, Weams?Yes, sir. Kings Cross has gone, and it's moving on to Farringdon.It's never moved as fast as this before!Hasn't moved at all the last three weeks, Miss.What started it up again all of a sudden?Can't say.Strange, isn't it, that all this should happen on the very day that your mysterious Doctor friend turns up?He hasn't turned up.Precisely. He could have sent those kids in here as spies.Rubbish! Would Jamie go away and leave Victoria, if he didn't intend coming back again?Excuse me, sir, but where is the young lady?Oh, in the Common Room, I suppose.No she's not, 'cos I went in there when I was looking for you!What? Well... where is she then?Jamie? Doctor?... Jamie? Doctor?Not a sign of her.We looked everywhere.Well then, she must have gone...Like I said, a couple of spies!Look, sir, the fungus! It's moving again!Hope the Captain and Staff Arnold ain't anywhere near that little lot.What is it, sir?Quiet! Listen.Quick, get in here.Soldier!Well, there's a sight for sore eyes!Are you stark raving mad?Aye, well I always sing when I'm scared, see.Stand to attention when you're talking to an officer!Name and serial!6-0...Shush!6-0-1 Evans, sir!Evans? Anybody know him?Oh, I'm not one of your lot, sir.Then what are you doing down here?Trying to get out, Sarge!Don't try to be funny with me, lad! How did you get down here in the first place?Driver on the ammo truck to Holborn. Got jumped, we did - quite a dust up, there was. Couldn't get past them hairy creatures, see? Been wandering for hours. Lost, I was. I tried one way, but there seemed to be some sort of cobweb muck moving down the tunnel.Moving? Are you sure it was moving?Well of course I'm sure!... sir. Sounds daft, I know, but it seemed to be following a Yeti that had a kind of pointed glass thing in its hands.Was it shaped like a pyramid?Well, I suppose it was, really.Well that's it! Smash the pyramid, and you put the Intelligence out of action!What Intelligence?Whereabouts did you say this happened?Kings Cross, Staff.What!Headquarters, sir - HQ may be in danger!Yes, we'd better get back as soon as we can. Come on.No, look...Now listen to what the officer said, young man. Come on!Look, I came down here to find the Doctor. I'm not going back till I have!Now look here...No, I'm not going! And if I get a chance to smash that pyramid, I will!That's quite a risk you're taking.Aye, but it's me that's taking it.Alright, it's your neck, chum.Sir!Yes?I'd like to volunteer to go with the young gentleman, sir.Well, you're not one of my lot... alright. Come on, the rest of you.Thanks!Don't be daft, boyo. First chance I get and I'm skipping!Liverpool Street gone now, sir.Aha... but still no movement on the southern section.No sign of the Captain yet.Once this stuff joins up, we've had it. Why don't we try and get out now, while we've still got a chance?Sounds like a very good idea to me...No, no! The decision to evacuate this fortress must be taken by Captain Knight!Yes, but where is he, father? He's been gone for ages!Let's just hope he's not on the Circle Line.Here we are, then. Cannon Street. Circle Line.We've gone miles out of our way!I told you I didn't know one tunnel from another, didn't I?Why didn't you tell me about these maps before?You never asked. Who wants to find a Yeti anyway?Monument next... then Tower Hill. Come on, we must find that pyramid.Oh, thank heavens you're back, Captain!Where are the other men?Gone.Captain, come here!...The southern section's on the move. Charing Cross and the Temple have gone.Look, Weams says there's a danger we might be cut off. Now don't you think it would be a very good idea if...If you want to leave, Mr Chorley, no-one's stopping you.Now, when did all this happen?Just after you left. Still no sign of the Doctor?None.Or the girl?Has she gone too?Yes.That means - all three of them are out there, sir.Yes - but where?Doctor? Jamie?... Doctor?I think we've had it, Corp!Yeah, that stuff's got us trapped, alright.Captain? Look, I know it seems hopeless, but... if we could find the Doctor! I'm sure he could help us.Perhaps. But I'm sure that he must be dead by now.If any of those three are on the Circle Line, sir - they've had it.Captain Knight? Captain Knight! Cannon Street and Tower Hill have gone now!That just leaves the Monument.Monument! Then it's Tower Hill next.Wait a minute! Did you hear something?What?Listen.Look! The fungus, it's here!We'd better get out, fast!We're trapped!We've had it, boyo! We can't go forward, and we can't go back!

        Sincro: wyxchariWhat are we going to do now, Staff?The main door should keep the fungus out of the tunnels for a bit. We must warn the others that HQ's had it.Right.Well, come on, then.Oh, oh no, not me.You're not disobeying an order, are you, Evans?Now look here, Staff. If we go up there, and this stuff breaks out, we'll be trapped!Now look, lad, you're scared, that's understandable. But you've been in the Army long enough to know that orders is orders. There's four people up there. If we don't warn them, they're for the chop.So? Four of them's getting the chop - there's no reason to make it six, is there?I've had enough of your lip for one day. Now come on! Follow me.



Evans! Come back here!Not on your nelly! Cheerio, Staff!Right, lad - I'll get you for this!Anne...Hey!Stop! Come back here!Stop! Anne, I've been thinking. Until we know who else is working for the Intelligence, everyone must be suspect.Yes?Well, the fewer people who know this chap's on our side, the better.Yes... yes, and whoever is the Intelligence is bound to know that you're controlling this Yeti.Mmm... I know.You are to remain here for... Do you think a minute will be enough?What for?For us to get clear.



Perhaps.You are to remain here for ninety seconds, and then resume acting on orders from the Intelligence until you are told otherwise. Is that understood?Right. Switch off, for ninety seconds, starting from... now.Come on, Anne.It is them! Come on!Am I glad to see you! There's fungus at Warren Street.Yes, I know.Oh. What are you doing down here, anyway?Well, as a matter of fact...I'll tell you another time. Hello, Colonel.Glad to see you're both safe. Any luck with your gadgets?No. No, I'm afraid not.Pity.Any news of Victoria?Yes, she's at Piccadilly Station.Piccadilly?Is my father there too?Aye, he's with her.Are they alright?Yes.How do you know?Ran across Arnold - he saw them.Arnold?Arnold! But Evans said - the fungus...Yes, he went into it, alright, but he came out again somehow. Says he can't remember what happened.Well we haven't got any time to find out.No, time's nearly up.Yes, your twenty minutes.Well come on, then.What are you going to do?We can't do anything until we get back to Headquarters, and... then, if we've got time, we'll try and increase the range of the control units. Come on!What is it, Colonel?Something up ahead.We can't go back!What, fungus, you mean?Yes.Is that you, Colonel?It's Arnold. Hang on, Staff!Why isn't he in HQ?Sir - the fungus. It's swamped HQ.No!I'm afraid so, sir. The main doors should keep it out of the tunnels for a bit, but...Where's Evans?Scarpered, sir.Our time's up! We're all together - they've come to fetch us!H... hello! If you... if you're looking for your friend, he went that way...Look, you don't want me!... I'm not one of them, see?... Driver, that's what I am... shouldn't be down here at all, really...Hey, steady on!Oh, going for a walk, are we? There's lovely.I'm going to make a break for it, sir.Think you can?Well, it's worth a try. On the loose, sir, I might be able to do something. If only you could distract them, sir.Right, Staff.I think it wants us to go on, sir.Right. Here we go.Wait!... Can't you see, he's fallen over!Be careful, be careful!Where are we being taken, Professor?Oh, to meet the Intelligence, I suppose.A pyramid!Yes - but it's different! We... we've never seen one like this before. It's fascinating! This must be the machine that the Intelligence intends using on the Doctor.Oh, no no. No, I shouldn't if I was you.Yes, I think perhaps you're right.There's someone there...What?There!Who's that? Who is it? D'you see who it was?No. Do you think it could have been...The Intelligence? If only we could do something!I'm sure the Doctor will think of something.No, not this time, Victoria. The Doctor would never risk the chance of the Intelligence harming you.You mean he'll just give in?Yes, I'm afraid so. Afraid there's no alternative.Yes, you're right, Professor. He has no alternative. I am sorry not to be here to welcome you personally, but I am sure you will not be offended. After all, the guest of honour is the Doctor - he, I am sure, will cooperate, as I advise you to do. Any attempt to interfere would be pointless. My Yeti can destroy you so easily.It's all my fault! If I hadn't tampered with that sphere - people killed, London invaded, all because of my wretched curiosity!Don't blame yourself, Professor.Why not? I... I've sacrificed you all! And for what?Why didn't you tell me all this before?Him.You don't think the Colonel...Well, you never know, do you?Which one is ours?I don't know.What!Well unfortunately I've lost track of him.Oh, that's a great help!Well, never mind, I... I want you to take this microphone and keep on calling our Yeti to you.How will I know I've got the right one?Well, you'll soon know if you haven't got the right one, won't you! Jamie, I hope you don't suffer from claustrophobia!Sergeant! Oh, oh thank heavens I found you! I've been wondering down here by myself for... for ages!Well well well, quite forgotten about you, we had, Mr Chorley!Tried to get out over the surface, but... there were Yeti everywhere! And there's this... this fungus, and fog, all around, you see, and... it's hopeless! I tried to get back to HQ, I tried, but... all the stations were locked, you see, and I couldn't get back in, and all the time I kept seeing more and more Yeti, and they were closing in on me. I was retreating... I was always retreating... and then, at last I found I could get into Piccadilly, but... when I got down there, there was this machine, and... the Professor, and the girl. And more Yeti... they're everywhere!My, my, my, we are in a state, aren't we, sir?Yes... alright... no, I'm fine. I've just been so scared, that's all!'S alright, sir, nothing to be ashamed of.Yes.There's just one thing that puzzles me though, sir.Oh, what's that?How you managed to exist all this time - why didn't the Yetis get you?I'm sorry, what are you suggesting? You're not suggesting that I...Oh no, sir, I was just wondering, that's all. I think perhaps you'd better come along with me, don't you, sir? Come on, now.Where's the control box?Hm?The control box!It's in my pocket.Well, why don't you use it on these Yeti? And then maybe we can escape!Oh, no. I must meet the Intelligence face to face.Doctor?What is it?Been thinking - the Yeti haven't noticed McCrimmon's disappearance yet. Not that I think he'll be able to achieve anything.Go on...Well, I don't really know how to say this, but, um... there's Miss Travers and Victoria to think of, and, er...You mean, am I going to give myself up?Yes. Of course, the decision must be yours, and yours alone. But the Intelligence did promise to release Travers and Victoria.You believe that?Well, why not?Hello, we've got company.Hello, sir!Evans, where the devil have you been?Didn't Staff Arnold tell you, sir?Yes. Sounded very like desertion to me.Desertion? Me? Oh, good heavens, no! No, I... I thought I'd try a single-handed and desperate attempt to rescue Professor Travers and the girl!Isn't Staff Arnold about?No.Good!Listen!...Now listen, everyone - when the Yeti come for you, don't struggle. Whatever you do, don't resist them!Don't struggle, he says! He must be joking!The Doctor will have to give in. There's no other choice!Aye, aye, time to get fell in!Thank you!Father! Oh, father, are you alright?Yes, I'm alright again... Don't, don't worry, Anne.Jamie and the Doctor - where are they?Oh.Anne?Yeti... come towards me... I'm standing beside the platform at Piccadilly Station!... Yeti, wherever you are, come towards me!Come towards me... Like that, that's it... Come to...Right now. Raise your right arm.Raise your right arm!Oh, what's the use?Well, there's nothing to be afraid of, dear. Just - just be calm.Doctor!The Doctor!Doctor!What are they going to do?Now don't worry, Victoria.But... I...Everything's under control. Don't be frightened.But Doctor, what are they going to do?Everything is under control. Tell her, Anne, you understand?Yes... yes, I think so.Now listen, everyone. Don't do anything foolish! I am perfectly alright.Yes, he is perfectly alright. Thank you, Doctor, for being so cooperative.Why don't you show yourself? Who are you?Silence! You will know soon enough.Chorley!Good grief!But that horrible little man...You, the Intelligence?No... no!No no no, he can't be the Intelligence, he can't! It doesn't make sense!It isn't me! It isn't me, don't you understand! I'm not the Intelligence! The Intelligence is him!It can't be!Oh, oh it's too horrible! I don't believe it!Arnold.No. Merely Arnold's lifeless body in which I have concealed myself. But let us to work. There will be time for discussion later. In fact, all the time in the world.Oh... so you weren't going to let us go then, afterwards?Did you think he would?The last member of the party. Come and join us!Oh, Jamie!Victoria, are you alright?Your solicitude is touching. Nevertheless, it is wasting time.Frightened that something might go wrong?Join the Doctor.Do what he says, Jamie.Take him!Leave him! Leave him be!I must ensure your complete cooperation, Doctor. Should you prove at all unhelpful, your young friend's neck will be broken.You gave your word that no one would be harmed. I refuse to submit until you release Jamie!Alright. Release the boy!But at the first sign of trouble from you...Don't worry. I will do what you say.Good. Into the machine, Doctor.Soon your mind will be absorbed by the Great Intelligence. You should be very proud, Doctor - your knowledge of the past will help to shape the future of this planet.Just get on with it, please.You seem very anxious suddenly.I just want it over and done with.Submission is essential. You must understand, Doctor, that without your complete cooperation, this transference would be of no value. Should you offer any opposition, either physical or mental, I shall be forced to punish you, or rather your friends. Prepare for a great darkness to cloud your mind.Attack now! Attack the Yeti!Stop it! Stop it!Get Arnold!No, Jamie, no!Come on, get the Doctor out!No, you don't understand, you'll ruin everything! No!Professor! Anne! Give us some help!No! No!... No! Leave me be! You don't understand, I've got to stay here!Well, that's that then, innit?You blithering Welsh imbecile! Why can't you do what you're told?Eh?Hey, now just a minute, Doctor! If we hadn't pulled you out of that, you'd have been a heap of dust by now.You're just as bad. I told you to leave it to me! Now you've gone and ruined everything!Ruined every - How can we! We... we've won, haven't we?No!What do you mean, Doctor?Oh, why didn't they leave it to me? I had crossed those wires on that helmet thing. The Intelligence wouldn't have drained me, I had... would have drained the Intelligence! As it is, all it got was a crossed circuit!You mean, all we've done is... is cut off its contact with Earth, it's - it's still out there in space somewhere, flying around?Precisely! Look!Oh!Oh, poor fellow!Do you mean to say that Arnold wasn't the Intelligence?No. He was just a poor soldier that was taken over. He was probably one of the first to disappear.You mean it might come back?Well, it's still around, isn't it? I've failed.Nonsense, man!You were marvellous.Yes. Great victory.I doubt it.No - you were a hero, and you know it.You don't really think so. Do you?Yes, yes I do.You've got to face facts, old man. Tomorrow you're going to be a household word, a national figure...Oh no, oh no!Yeah! I want you on my television programme, and...Oh no!...and a big Press Conference, and...Jamie! Victoria! Come along, it's time we left!...but the Press Conference, Doctor!Goodbye!But Doctor, Doctor, you... you can't go yet, there are a lot of things I want to discuss with you!I'm sorry, Travers, we have to go.Where are you going?Covent Garden! Come along. Come along, Jamie.Bye!... Bye.Where's he going?Huh? Oh, er, back to his TARDIS, I suppose.You mean this, uh, this time machine thing, it really exists?Y... well I, er... oh, explain it to him, Anne, will you?Colonel, I think we'd better check up top, don't you?Right, Professor. Evans!Father - father, I...Now don't you go, Miss Travers, I'd er, I'd like you to explain all about this, this time machine for me.Oh dear...!Well, where do we go? Which is the way to Covent Garden?Oh, don't ask me. I've completely lost my bearings.All these tunnels look the same to me.Come on, let's try this way.Well it doesn't matter, anyway. I mean, there's no danger, is there?Well, not from the Yeti, no, but who knows, they might suddenly start the trains again! Come on!Trains?Oh!Come on!
